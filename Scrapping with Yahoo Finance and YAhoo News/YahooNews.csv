6,Australia digests report of Afghan military killings,"Australians reacted with shock and distress on Friday (November 20), a day after the release of a report alleging Australian special forces killed 39 unarmed civilians and prisoners in Afghanistan.  The report has been described by national leaders as one of the darkest military chapters for Australia, just one week after the country's Remembrance Day for fallen soldiers. Military personnel spoke against the report saying they felt vindicated by the inquiry. Linda Reynolds is Australia's Defence Minister and a former army officer: ""How do I feel? I got the report two weeks ago and it made me physically ill and it was a very distressing read because I know that it doesn't, it certainly didn't represent my service"" The report found evidence of 'blooding,' an alleged practice where senior commanders would coerce junior soldiers to kill defenseless captives in Afghanistan to achieve their first kill. The inquiry, which was conducted over four years, examined more than 20,000 documents, 25,000 images, and interviewed 423 witnesses under oath. Some officials walked a delicate line of condemning the severity of the report's findings, while expressing solidarity with the country's armed forces. Josh Frydenberg is Australia's Treasurer: ""These allegations should not overshadow the remarkable work by the men and women in the Australian Defence Force. Thousands have been deployed on assignment around the world defending our national interests and making Australia and the world a safer place."" The report recommended referring 19 current and former soldiers to a soon-to-be appointed special investigator for potential prosecution. Reynolds has said that Canberra has been advised that if local prosecutions went ahead, it would negate charges at the International Criminal Court at The Hague.",World News

8,Hong Kong’s tour bus “cemetery”,"Standing empty and redundant, hundreds of tour buses are gathering dust at a container port in Hong Kong. They've been off the road for ten months after authorities banned all non-resident arrivals to the city due to the global health crisis. The measure has effectively decimated Hong Kong's once booming tourism industry. It was the world's leading tourist city last year with some 56 million visitors.  The sector accounts for about 5% of Hong Kong's GDP, but numbers have been down 96 to 99% year-on-year every month since February. It's worrying for the some 260,000 people directly employed in the sector. Freddy Yip is one of them. He's the president of Hong Kong's Travel Agent Owners Association, and says that once the government's wage subsidy ends in November, his business could collapse. ""My company, like other company, of course, look for the subsidy from the government"" he said. ""Once the government subsidy stop we need to trim down all the expenses, keep as small as possible.'' The wage subsidy program was first introduced in June and helped about two million employees in all types of industries. The government has ruled out extending it beyond this month, citing the high cost. One positive for the industry, though, is a travel bubble with Singapore which is due to begin this week. It will allow a limited number of people to move between the cities without needing to quarantine. But tour guide Mimi Cheung isn't optimistic about how much of a boost it will be and says people will be put off by the cost. ""I don't think the 'travel bubble' will help boost tourism. Singapore has many regulations and rules."" In the mean time, dozens of travel agencies have told staff to take unpaid leave from December, saying they can no longer afford to pay salaries or rent.",World News

13,Vietnam threatens to shut down Facebook: source,"Vietnam has threatened to shut down Facebook in the country, if the social media giant refuses to bow to government pressure and censor more political content on its platform. That's according to a senior official at the company, which has faced mounting pressure from governments over its content policies. But it's also faced criticism from rights groups for being too compliant with government censorship requests. Vietnam's ruling Communist Party retains tight control of the media in its country, despite opening up to more social change. Facebook's local servers in Vietnam were taken offline early this year until it complied with the government's demands. The official told Reuters the company complied with a government request in April to increase censorship of ""anti-state"" posts for some 60 million Vietnamese users. It then asked the company to step up its restrictions again in August, which the official says Facebook refused. Vietnam is a major market for Facebook, where it generates revenue amounting to nearly a billion dollars. The platform is also a source of scrutiny for the Vietnamese government, as the country's main site for both e-commerce and expressions of political dissent. Vietnam has tried to launch home-grown social media networks to compete with Facebook, with little success. Amnesty International said the fact Facebook had not yet been banned despite defying the Vietnamese government's threats showed the company could do more to resist, adding that ""Facebook are prioritising profits in Vietnam, and failing to respect human rights."" The country ranks fifth from the bottom in a global ranking of press freedom compiled by Reporters Without Borders.",World News
