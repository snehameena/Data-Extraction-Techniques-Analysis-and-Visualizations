She died inside the church.The body of a man, a 55-year-old church employee, was found nearby inside the basilica, his throat also slit.Another woman, a 44-year-old who had fled the church to a nearby restaurant, died shortly afterwards from multiple knife wounds.READ: France attack: Church sexton had throat slit while preparing for Mass\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementThe victims were \"people targeted for the sole reason that they were present in this church at that moment\",\u00a0said Ricard.The attack, he added, was a reminder that \"the deadly ideology of Islamist terrorism is very much alive\".Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi told journalists at the scene the attacker \"kept repeating 'Allahu Akbar' even while under medication\" as he was taken to hospital.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA woman kneels by a police car and cries in Nice after the attack.

The industry moved less dramatically toward Democrats in 2018 during the congressional elections.Senior pharmaceutical executives lean Republican, while workers' donations skew toward Democrats and largely supported Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden, data shows. Biden leads Republican President Donald Trump in national opinion polls in the last week before next Tuesday's election.The industry-level shift, based on support from non-profit political action committees affiliated with drug companies, funded by employees and directed by executives and staff, reflects a consensus that Democrats will expand their hold on the House of Representatives and may gain control of the Senate.Pharma companies aim to build close relationships with politicians who are likely to be in power, and usually avoid presidential races and close congressional campaigns, said an industry executive who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementHe and other industry sources said drugmakers were aiming  to head off efforts by Democrats to slash drug prices paid by Medicare, a government-run health insurance program for seniors, industry sources said.\u201cThey are interested in funding whoever they think might win,\u201d said David Gartner, professor of law at Arizona State University who focuses on U.S. healthcare policy.That may mean contributing to lawmakers who disagree with the industry.A plan earlier this year that was stymied by Senate Republicans would have reduced pharma revenues from Medicare by more than US$300 billion by the end of the decade, the Congressional Budget Office calculated.\n    AdvertisementTrump, in a departure from his party, has issued several executive orders meant to cut drug prices, but experts say their impact will be limited by legal and other problems and that a Democratic Congress could mount a more serious challenge.SHIFT IN SUPPORTThe biggest pharma PAC donations so far this year have come from Pfizer Inc, Amgen Inc, Abbvie Inc and Johnson & Johnson, which all shifted support toward Democrats between 2016 and 2020, records show. Pfizer\u2019s change was the most dramatic, giving 63per cent of its funds to Republicans in 2016 and 51per cent in 2020.In the 2018 election cycle, in which Democrats took control of the House, some 57per cent of the industry\u2019s more than US$17 million in donations went to Republicans. Industry PACs leaned Republican during each federal election in the past eight years by varying margins, political donation data shows.Pharma industry employees, who are concentrated in Democratic-leaning hubs including California, Massachusetts and New York, consistently tilt Democratic. They are supporting Biden at a rate of about 4 to 1 or roughly US$6 million to US$1.5 million in donations, data show.Top executives, however, lean Republican. A Reuters review of top pharma executives showed a nearly 2-1 split in favor of Republicans, with more than US$150,000 going to Republicans and around US$75,000 to Democrats. Individual donations tend to reflect personal political leanings, experts said.A broader measure of individual donations that covers the entire healthcare industry and includes donations to super PACs, which can take unlimited funds and often attract wealthy donors, shows Trump receiving about US$60 million to Biden's US$54 million, according to CRP data.There are broad concerns that the Trump administration is inserting political issues into regulatory decisions, which could indirectly hurt the drug industry's reputation.But Aaron Kesselheim, a Harvard Medical School specialist in U.S. healthcare policy, said: \u201cI don\u2019t really think that has much to do with political donations, which are trying to curry favor with the party that seems to be ascendant.\"(Reporting by Carl O'Donnell; Editing by Peter Henderson and Peter Cooney)"},

The lawsuit argued that Trump's order violates free speech rights and strangles workplace attempts to address systemic race and sex discrimination.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementThe National Urban League and the National Fair Housing Alliance both have federal contracts and plan to apply for future ones.The executive order \u201cunconstitutionally forces Plaintiffs to choose between censoring speech on these important issues or forfeiting any opportunity to enter into a federal contract,\u201d the groups argued in the complaint.Trump\u2019s executive order, signed last month, called out workplace trainings that explore deep-seated racism and privilege that the administration says could make white workers feel \u201cdiscomfort\u201d or guilt. The president ordered the Labor Department to set up a hotline to investigate complaints about training sessions that Trump has called \u201canti-American\u201d and \u201cblame-focused.\u201dTrump has said he is targeting training based on \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d the idea that racism has permeated American history and institutions. At the first presidential debate, Trump said such training is \u201cteaching people to hate our country.\u201d\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementThe directive uses a 55-year-old presidential order spurred by the Civil Rights Movement that sought to ban discriminatory practices at companies that contract with the federal government. Critics say Trump's order twists President Lyndon B\u00a0Johnson\u2019s 1965 initiative into vehicle for white grievances.\u201cThe executive order smacks of a totalitarian endorsement of white supremacy,\u201d Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League said at a virtual press conference.Morial called the order a \u201cdirect attack on our mission.\u201d According to the lawsuit, the National Urban League has a federal contract that includes developing diversity and inclusion training programs for the Department of Labor\u2019s apprenticeship programs.The Department of Labor says the order does not ban \u201cunconscious bias\u201d training that discusses \u201cpre-conceptions, opinions, or stereotypes\u201d that people might have about others. But it prohibits training that that implies anyone is racist or sexist \u201cby virtue of his or her race, sex, and/or national origin.\u201d\n    AdvertisementThe lawsuit, however, said the wording of the order is overly broad and is already having a chilling effect on diversity training. Some organisations have asked that words including \u201csystemic racism\u201d and \u201cwhite privilege\u201d be banned from training, the complaint said. It also cited the University of Iowa\u2019s decision to suspend its diversity efforts for fear of losing government funding.Michelle Lee, co-founder and CEO of Awaken, which provides diversity and inclusion workshops, said one of her clients -\u00a0a private company with a government contract -\u00a0reached out shortly after the order was issued to ask if she could omit \u201cwhite privilege\u201d from a speech she planned to give to its employees. Lee said she pushed back, saying she did not believe that language would violate the order, and the company relented.\u201cI did give the speech and I was extra spicy. Not only did talk about white privilege but I extended that further to talk about white supremacy culture,\u201d Lee said.She said another client, a non-profit that relies on government grants, has asked if Awaken planned to reformulate its training. But Lee said no professional diversity trainer would imply that any group has unconscious bias without proper context.\u201cOf course we are not going to stand up and say, \u2018you people are inherently racist,'\" Lee said.Within the government, the Justice Department has suspended all diversity and inclusion training. The government has also cancelled training programs at the State Department, Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Veteran Affairs.The National Fair Housing Association, which currently has a contract with Department of Housing and Urban Development, said in the lawsuit that it routinely conducts internal training and discussions to address \u201csystemic racism, unconscious bias, and racial inequities.\u201d Those include recent \u201cinformal conversation\" with employees concerning \u201cperceptions of white people and other demographic groups in connection with the killing of George Floyd.\u201dThe Labor Department is also using the 1965 presidential order to target companies, including Microsoft and Wells Fargo, over public commitments to expand or bolster Black and Hispanic representation in leadership roles. The government opened inquiries into both companies, warning them against using \u201cdiscriminatory practices\u201d to meet their goals."},

She said searchers have found indications that more bodies may be buried there, so the search continues. The goal is to recover the bodies, identify them and return the remains to their families, she said.Quintana said many victims seemed young and there were a significant number of women. Quintana announced the find late on Wednesday, calling it \u201ca sad and terrible discovery.\u201dThe bodies were extracted over the last week from 52 pits at a property in Salvatierra. The scene was considered dangerous enough that the army and National Guard provided security for the excavations. The area is near the border with Michoacan state and there is known to be a significant organised crime presence.On Thursday, the site of the burial pits was cordoned off by police.\n    AdvertisementLeticia Valencia, the mother of a missing man, waited outside the police perimeter, hoping she might be allowed to enter to look for any signs her son might have been among the bodies buried there.\u201cWhat I want to do is to be allowed to go inside, to see if I can recognise any of the clothing they have excavated,\u201d Valencia.Valencia's son, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Fabi\u00e1n Valencia, disappeared along with a friend in 2018, and has not been heard from since. It's a tale of desperation heard all too frequently in Guanajuato.But when photos began circulating on social media this week of the excavations at the vacant lot, among the items pulled from the graves was a boot that Valencia thought might be her son's.That glimmer of hope - of at least finding her son's remains, and be able to finally say farewell to him -\u00a0led her to the excavation site.\u201cHe could be here,\u201d she said.Guanajuato has been the scene of bloody turf battles between the Jalisco cartel and local gangs backed by the Sinaloa cartel.President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said on Thursday the situation in Guanajuato is \u201cvery difficult.\u201d He said the deployment of the National Guard in the state was at least allowing authorities to reach areas that were previously inaccessible due to the sway of organised crime."},

It also firms up opposition to regional power Iran, which the UAE, Israel and the United States view as the main threat in the conflict-riven Middle East.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementIsrael had signed peace agreements with Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994. But the UAE, along with most other Arab nations, did not recognise Israel and had no formal diplomatic or economic relations with it until now. It becomes the first Gulf Arab country to reach such a deal with the Jewish state.Officials from the three countries called the accord \"historic\" and a breakthrough toward peace. But Palestinian leaders, apparently taken by surprise, denounced it as a \"stab in the back\" to their cause.A joint statement said Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed had \"agreed to the full normalisation of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates\".The accord will allow the two countries \"to chart a new path that will unlock the great potential in the region,\" it said.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementIsrael and the UAE are expected soon to exchange ambassadors and embassies. A signing ceremony is due to be held at the White House.\"As a result of this diplomatic breakthrough and at the request of President Trump with the support of the United Arab Emirates, Israel will suspend declaring sovereignty\" over areas of the West Bank as envisioned in a US\u00a0plan announced by Trump in January, it said.The agreement, to be known as the Abraham Accord, also gives Trump a foreign policy accomplishment as he seeks re-election on Nov\u00a03. Speaking in the White House Oval Office, Trump said similar deals are being discussed with other countries in the region.Trump said the agreement unites \"two of America's closest and most capable partners in the region\" and represents \"a significant step towards building a more peaceful, secure and prosperous Middle East.\"\n    AdvertisementREAD:\u00a0Trump scores diplomatic deal with Middle East allies before electionThe UAE said it would remain a strong supporter of the Palestinian people, who hope to create an independent state in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and that the agreement maintained the viability of a two-state solution to the longstanding Israel-Palestinian conflict.The accord could also be a personal boost to Netanyahu, who is on trial for alleged corruption and whose domestic popularity has dropped over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.In a televised address, Netanyahu said the deal would lead to \"full and formal peace\" with the UAE and voiced hope that other countries in the region would follow its example. It also entailed acceding to a request from Trump to \"temporarily wait\" on implementing his annexation pledge, Netanyahu said.\"It's an incomparably exciting moment, a historic moment for peace in the Middle East,\" Netanyahu added.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, however, rejected the accord. Spokesman Abu Rudeineh, reading from a statement outside Abbas's headquarters in Ramallah in the West Bank, said it was a \"betrayal of Jerusalem, Al-Aqsa (mosque, Islam's third-holiest shrine) and the Palestinian cause\".Asked if the Palestinian leadership had been aware the deal was coming, veteran negotiator Hanan Ashrawi told Reuters: \"No. We were blindsided\u00a0... It is a complete sell-out.\"In Gaza, Fawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for the armed Islamist group Hamas, said: \"Normalisation is a stab in the back of the Palestinian cause and it serves only the Israeli occupation.\"The UAE's Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed said the agreement would stop further Israeli annexation of Palestinian territories, for which Israel had been awaiting a green light from Washington.Senior UAE official Anwar Gargash said the deal had helped defuse what he called a ticking time-bomb. Gargash urged the Israelis and Palestinians to return to the negotiating table.'NIGHTMARE' FOR IRANTrump's special envoy Brian Hook called the agreement a \"nightmare\" for Iran. An Iranian official said the agreement would not secure peace in the region.Railing against \"criminal Israel\", Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, a special adviser to Iran's parliamentary speaker, said in a tweet: \"Abu Dhabi's behaviour has no justification, turning back on the Palestine cause. W/ that strategic mistake, #UAE will be engulfed in Zionism fire.\"Iran and Israel are arch foes. Israel is particularly concerned about suspected Iranian efforts to develop nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies. Iran is also involved in proxy wars from Syria to Yemen, where the UAE has been a leading member of the Saudi-led coalition opposing Iran-aligned forces there.With a population of less than 10 million but the Arab world's second-largest economy thanks to oil, the UAE has exerted growing commercial and military clout in the Gulf and the wider region over the past two decades, much of it aimed at confronting Islamist militants and the influence of Iran.Delegations from Israel and the United Arab Emirates will meet in the coming weeks to sign agreements regarding investment, tourism, direct flights, security, telecommunications and other issues, the joint statement said.\"Everybody said this would be impossible,\" Trump said.\"Now that the ice has been broken, I expect more Arab and Muslim countries will follow the United Arab Emirates' lead,\" Trump added.This was already being discussed with other states, he said."},

But the length of follow-up in phase three trials is vital and cannot be sped up in quite the same way.The end of phase two reveals whether a vaccine produces an immune response.\u00a0But just because an immune response is produced, does not mean that a vaccine will protect against infection or disease.Examples in Russia and China highlight the possibility of widespread use of a vaccination before phase three trials.\u00a0READ:\u00a0Commentary: Want to travel again?

It was done by thugs who have nothing to do with Islam,\" said Kemadou Gassama, a Paris imam.The political temperature is also rising, with French President Emmanuel Macron promising that \"fear is about to change sides\" in a new anti-Islamist campaign.Far-right National Rally leader Marine Le Pen - likely to face Macron in a 2022 presidential election - has called for \"wartime legislation\" and an immediate moratorium on immigration.Paty's beheading was the second knife attack since a trial started last month over the Charlie Hebdo killings.In the September attack, two people were wounded outside the publication's former offices.A silent rally is being planned for Tuesday evening in homage to Paty, and Macron will attend a ceremony organised with the teacher's family on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Paris prosecutors said they had opened an investigation into a French neo-Nazi website hosted abroad that republished the photo of Paty's decapitated corpse posted to Twitter by the killer."},

It was done by thugs who have nothing to do with Islam,\" said Kemadou Gassama, a Paris imam.The political temperature is also rising, with French President Emmanuel Macron promising that \"fear is about to change sides\" in a new anti-Islamist campaign.Far-right National Rally leader Marine Le Pen - likely to face Macron in a 2022 presidential election - has called for \"wartime legislation\" and an immediate moratorium on immigration.Paty's beheading was the second knife attack since a trial started last month over the Charlie Hebdo killings.In the September attack, two people were wounded outside the publication's former offices.A silent rally is being planned for Tuesday evening in homage to Paty, and Macron will attend a ceremony organised with the teacher's family on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Paris prosecutors said they had opened an investigation into a French neo-Nazi website hosted abroad that republished the photo of Paty's decapitated corpse posted to Twitter by the killer."},

The mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, who had attended last year's unveiling of the intercom, said this was how police were first alerted to the attack.David said the police arrived on the scene within 30 seconds, while he went back inside his bakery and pulled down the blinds.SHOUTS OF ALLAHU AKBARThe first police on the scene were four officers from the Nice municipal force. They entered the church through the entrance on Rue d'Italie, and saw the attacker.\"From the accounts of the police, the man advanced towards them in a threatening manner, shouting 'Allahu Akbar',\" said Ricard. The term is Arabic for God is Greatest. The officers fired Tasers, then used service side-arms. Fourteen spent bullet cases were found at the scene.In video footage obtained by Reuters, shot from a balcony across the street from the church, police officers with guns and Tasers raised could be seen in the side entrance of the church, looking inside. Gunshots could be heard. It was not clear from the footage what they were shooting at.READ:\u00a0Church attack in Nice: What we know so farFootage from the same balcony vantage point later showed a man with dark hair on an ambulance gurney being wheeled away from the church and into a waiting ambulance.

WHAT ARE POLDERS?Polders are tracts of land that lie below sea level and are reclaimed from the ocean, lakes, rivers or wetlands through the building of dykes, drainage canals and pumping stations, according to Dutch experts that CNA spoke to.\u00a0\u201cPolders are land reclamations, but not all land reclamations are polders. When the level of the land is higher than sea level and no pumping is required, there is no polder,\u201d said Associate Professor Mick van der Wegen from the IHE Delft Institute for Water Education.\u00a0Hence a key feature of polders, according to Mr Nauta from Deltares, is that they are \u201chydrologically separated\u201d from their surroundings.\u00a0\u201cThis means you can control the water within a polder through pumping stations usually.\u201d\u00a0It works like this: The submerged area is first enclosed, or sometimes partially, by a dyke to keep water out. Water from within is then drained, creating a polder \u2013 dry land that is lower than sea level.\u00a0A polder is kept dry by an extensive grid of canals \u2013 from small drains to big canals with sluice gates to control water flow \u2013 and pumps. Retention areas may be created to store water in case of emergencies.\u201cExcess water will flow over land if you don\u2019t create space so you will always see canals in polders. From there, we will pump it out,\u201d said Mr Mark van Zanten, a senior project manager at Dutch engineering consultancy firm Royal HaskoningDHV, who is involved in the polder development on Pulau Tekong.While the most iconic images of the Dutch landscape usually show polders as rectangular plots of flat land, they can come in other shapes and have various heights \u2013 still below sea level.These height variations can be naturally-occurring from sea or river beds. They can also be man-made, when sand is added to make the land suitable for residential and other purposes, said experts.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe 4,450-hectare Noordwaard polder is one of the thousands of polders that form a\u00a0crucial part of the Dutch landscape.

WHAT ARE POLDERS USED FOR?Agriculture remains a common use, as seen by vast fields dotted by farmhouses and grazing cows, as well as canals and the occasional windmill.\u00a0Polders are also used for other purposes in the Netherlands, including providing land for residential, commercial, industrial and military needs.\u00a0Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol Airport is built on polder land, which was created by the draining of the Haarlemmer Lake in 1852.\u00a0\u201cTechnically, the airport lies on the bottom of the lake, over four metres below sea level \u2026 making Schiphol one of the world's most low-lying airports,\u201d according to its website.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nHouses are built on this polder area in the city of Delft which lies more than 6 metres below the sea level.

WHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS?Experts said the Dutch model of polders uses less sand\u00a0compared with regular reclamation, which heightens the land above sea level.\u00a0However polders will require constant pumping to be kept dry, while dykes have to be maintained regularly.\u00a0\u201cThere is a larger flood risk due to precipitation or dyke breaches,\u201d said Assoc Prof van der Wegen. \u201cOn the other hand, high reclaimed land has less flooding risk and may be cheaper in maintenance (as it requires) no pumping\u201d.\u00a0Echoing that, Mr van Zanten said: \u201cConstruction costs are higher for land reclamation but the annual costs after that are much lower.\u00a0\u201cBut for a polder, operations and maintenance of the system, like the pumps, are important so the annual costs are higher though initial costs are lower.\u201dHighlighting another consideration in the area of energy consumption, Mr Nauta said: \u201cFrom windmills to steam engines and now, pumping machines, we keep on pumping to keep the Netherlands dry.\u00a0\u201cIf an energy crisis hits us, it will hit us badly.\u201dThe Netherlands is also facing the problem of land subsidence \u2013 shrinking and consolidation of land \u2013 especially in the country\u2019s peat-rich land areas.\u00a0\u201cIf you pump out water, the peat oxidises and becomes smaller. That means the land goes down,\u201d explained Mr Nauta. \u201cPeat and polders are unfortunately not the best combination.\u201d\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nFarmland in the Netherlands.

These firms are major users of H-1B visas for shifting professionals from India to their US offices.The move also impacts the US tech industry. For decades, the H-1B and L visas have been instrumental in supplying high-quality Indian talent to frontline tech companies and start-ups in the Silicon Valley.Angry responses from all across the US tech industry were hardly surprising. Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon and several other firms argued that blocking skilled foreign professionals from entering the US would affect the competitiveness of the American tech sector at a critical time for post-pandemic recovery.The long-term impact of the suspension might be cushioned if it doesn\u2019t last beyond 2020. But if it does, then Indian IT businesses might be forced to consider relocating parts of their American operations elsewhere, such as Canada or Mexico, for servicing the North American market.Businesses like Shopify are already highlighting advantages of Canada\u2019s liberal immigration policy for attracting foreign talent.READ: Commentary: Soon you may be competing with talent globally.

The country has a long history of using structures on water for living and working, but technological advancements seem to have made this more feasible and practical.\u00a0The concept of building on water is increasingly seen by some as a solution to land disappearing as a result of rising sea levels brought about by climate change.In the north of Amsterdam, a new floating residential development is near completion.Called Schoonschip, which means \u201cClean Ship\u201d, there are currently 26 floating houses ranging from 90 to 210 square metres each. Four more units are set to be completed latest by the start of next year.\u00a0Each house has three levels, including a basement that is completely under water.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nSchoonschip is located in the north of Amsterdam.

On top, we put wooden structures.\u201d\u00a0The houses are also fixed to two poles anchored to the river bed.\u201cSo they can go up and down (the poles) if there are waves and if water levels rise, the houses will still be floating,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science but you\u2019ll need to calculate it well.\u201d\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThere are currently 26 floating houses in the Schoonschip neighbourhood.\u00a0Schoonschip means \"Clean Ship\".

Excess energy is\u00a0stored in a battery and one can choose to \u201csell\u201d it to the rest of the community through a \u201csmart grid\u201d.\u00a0\u201cWe have been given an \u2018experimental status\u2019 from the government because here in the Netherlands, you are not allowed to generate your own electricity and sell it,\u201d said Mr Glasl.\u00a0Residents will also be doing electric car and bike-sharing via an app.\n        \n            \n            \n                        \n\nThe community at Schoonschip has their electric car and bike-sharing app.\u00a0(Photo: Tang See Kit)\n                \n        It is this idea of living sustainably within a like-minded community that attracted Corine Dikkers. So much so that the 37-year-old and her boyfriend will be sharing a floating house with another family.\u00a0\u201cWhen we heard about this project which has a focus on sustainability, we were so enthusiastic. We are also very excited because it\u2019s our first house on the water.\u201dMs Dikkers said she is not expecting any challenges when it comes to living in a floating house, except in the area of furniture planning.\u201cIf you have too many things on one side, you have to compensate on the other side so we have tiles and dead loads that you can move around to do some fine-tuning in stability,\u201d she told CNA.\u00a0\u201cBut I\u2019m not worried because this house is designed to be on the water.\u201d\u201cNEW POLDERS\u201dThe marrying of the country\u2019s expertise in water and a huge emphasis on sustainability is what these projects hope to offer as a future solution for the Netherlands in face of climate change.\u00a0Surrounded on one end by the North Sea and with three of Europe\u2019s major rivers \u2013 the Rhine, Meuse and Scheldt \u2013 running through the country, about two-thirds of the Netherlands is vulnerable to flooding.\u00a0For centuries, the Dutch have built dykes, canals, windmills and pumps to keep the water out. In doing so, they created polders \u2013 a uniquely Dutch term referring to reclaimed land that lies below sea level \u2013 out of previously unusable waterlogged areas.But polders require constant pumping and regular maintenance of its dykes to be kept dry. It has also raised problems, such as subsidence particularly in the western part of the country.\n        \n            \n            \n                        \n\nA polder in the south of the Netherlands.

It is unclear who can unite America even after results are in.PERVASIVE CONFIRMATION BIASWhy is America so polarised?Part of the problem is human psychology. Instead of being open to new perspectives, Americans (like all people) have a tendency to interpret new facts as being consistent with their strongly held beliefs.This propensity, known as confirmation bias, is well understood. Nobel prize-winning cognitive psychologist Daniel Kahneman explained: \u201cConfirmation bias comes from when you have an interpretation, and you adopt it, and then, top down, you force everything to fit that interpretation.\u201dREAD: Commentary: Facebook\u2019s safeguards for the US election are the right moveToday's unprecedented polarisation largely results from the toxic mixture of confirmation bias and an explosion of information. The Internet is an elaborate global menu allowing people to pick and choose what they want to believe.Facebook, for example, is a leading source for voters to get information about the Trump\u00a0and Biden campaigns. As of 2019, 52 per cent of US adults rely on Facebook for their news, according to Pew Research Center.And the social media giant, like other online platforms, is scrupulously engineered to feed users news and opinions that they are already predisposed to agree with. A 2015 Facebook study found that of the news stories that a user\u2019s friends share, only 29.5 per cent cuts across ideological lines.As a result of this echo chamber, Americans have hardened into camps: Democrat or Republican; liberal or conservative; Black Lives Matter or Blue Lives Matter. They\u2019ve grown more distant from and averse to alternative perspectives.READ: Commentary: Who\u2019s winning the social media race \u2013 Trump or Biden?BIASES ON BOTH SIDESExamples of confirmation bias that leads to polarisation in US politics are endless.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nSupporter wearing a Trump face mask due to the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, cheers as U.S. President Donald Trump holds a campaign rally at Middle Georgia Regional Airport in Macon, Georgia, U.S., October 16, 2020.

And grading economic performance requires looking beyond the stock market.But to ignore Obama\u2019s historically impressive stock market record, while touting Trump's performance, is confirmation bias on full display.READ: Obama blasts Trump's tweets, track record in 2020 campaign trail debutREAD: Commentary: Who cares if US President Donald Trump pays only US$750 in taxes?On the other side of the aisle, there is the constant liberal drumbeat that Trump is soft on Russia \u2013 and that Joe Biden, if elected, would take a harder line against America\u2019s cold war adversary.But Trump has sanctioned Russia repeatedly, expelled Russian diplomats from the US and sold arms to Russian foe Ukraine.Trump in April 2018 also ordered the bombing of Russian ally Syria, where Russia's military maintains a significant presence. Russian president Vladimir Putin called the strikes an \u201cact of aggression\u201d that could \u201chave a destructive effect on the entire system of international relations\u201d.True, Trump's relationship with Russia is complicated and his behaviour regarding Putin raises legitimate concerns.

They will exchange embassies and ambassadors, and begin cooperation across the board and on a broad range of areas, including tourism, education, healthcare, trade and security.\"The chance to play global statesman was compelling for Trump, who trails in public opinion polls ahead of what is shaping up as a tough election battle against Democratic challenger Joe Biden and has struggled to contain the coronavirus pandemic that has battered the US\u00a0economy.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementTwo of the Republican president's primary Middle East endeavors have sputtered in the past year. The new agreement, known as the Abraham Accord, has the potential to impact both.Trump has been unable to negotiate what has been billed as the \"deal of the century\" between Israel and the Palestinians, and a peace plan he proposed in January that heavily favored the Israelis has not advanced in any significant way.Trump, who walked away from the international nuclear deal with Iran, also has been unable to get concessions from Tehran in spite of a \"maximum pressure\" campaign aimed at isolating the Iranians.Israel and the UAE, along with the another strong regional US\u00a0ally in Saudi Arabia, count Iran as an important enemy, bolstering their joint opposition to Tehran.\n    AdvertisementBrian Hook, the US\u00a0State Department's lead official on Iran who will be leaving his post soon, said the new agreement amounted to a \"nightmare\" for Iran in its efforts against Israel in the region.The Netanyahu government's West Bank annexation plans had been an uncomfortable development for Washington, seen by many as a possible death knell to the US\u00a0peace plan.US\u00a0Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, asked how long Israel might suspend its annexation plan, said it was unclear but that the administration wanted to give other countries in the region a chance to seal similar agreements with Israel.\"We've prioritised peace over the sovereignty movement but it\u2019s not off the table. It's just something that will be deferred until we give peace every single chance,\" he told reporters at the White House.The UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, said that the agreement with Israel was done to address the threat that further annexation of Palestinian territories posed to the two-state solution.A UAE representative was on hand in the White House ceremony when Trump unveiled the accord.The agreement also deepens Washington's alliance with the Emiratis, to whom the Trump administration has pushed to sell weapons over the objections of members of Congress angry over civilian casualties in the war in Yemen.MORE DEALS IN THE WORKS?White House officials said Trump senior adviser Jared Kushner, Friedman and Middle East envoy Avi Berkowitz were deeply involved in negotiating the deal, as well as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien.Echoing comments by Trump, Kushner told reporters in a conference call that other countries in the region may now come forward to strike a similar deal with Israel.\"We've had numerous conversations with other Arab and Muslim countries in the region,\" Kushner said.Kushner said discussions between US, Israeli and UAE officials had been taking place for the past year and a half but accelerated in the past six weeks and an agreement in principle for a deal was reached a week ago, with details completed on Wednesday.Israel has had no diplomatic relations with Gulf Arab countries, but common concerns with the UAE about Iran's regional influence and activities had led to a limited thaw in relations in recent years. The UAE previously had warned that Israel could not expect to normalise relations with the Arab world if it annexed land in the occupied West Bank.Biden said he was \"gratified\" by the announcement of the agreement. He said he had personally spent time with leaders of both Israel and the UAE as vice president under Barack Obama building the case for cooperation and broader engagement.\"It is a timely reminder that enmities and differences - even long standing ones - are not set in stone, and of the role American diplomacy can play,\" Biden added."},

He had fired shots at police and tried to stab them as they closed in on him.He was in turn shot nine times, said Ricard.Locals in the Normandy town of Evreux where the attacker lived in the Madeleine district described him as low key.One who had been to school with him said he had become noticeably religious in recent years.\"Before, he got involved in fights but for the last two or three years he had calmed down\" and had been \"immersed in religion\", he said.Friday's attack was the second such incident since a trial started last month into the January 2015 massacre at the offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine, which had published caricatures of the prophet that unleashed a wave of anger across the Islamic world.The magazine republished the cartoons in the run-up to the trial, and last month a young Pakistani man wounded two people with a meat cleaver outside Charlie Hebdo's former Paris offices.Ricard said Paty's murder illustrated \"the very high-level terrorist threat\" France still faces.MACRON THREATThe attacker himself was not known to the French intelligence services, said the prosecutor.An investigation is under way into \"murder linked to a terrorist organisation\".The investigation will also look at a tweet from an account opened by the attacker, and since shut down, that showed a picture of Paty's head and described Macron as \"the leader of the infidels\".Macron's office said a national tribute would be held for Paty on Wednesday.On Saturday, hundreds of pupils, teachers and parents flooded to Paty's school to lay white roses.Some carried placards stating: \"I am a teacher\" and \"I am Samuel\" - echoing the \"I am Charlie\" cry that travelled around the world after the 2015 Charlie Hebdo killings.Martial, a 16-year-old pupil, said Paty had loved his job: \"He really wanted to teach us things.\"According to parents and teachers, Paty gave Muslim children the option to leave the classroom before he showed the cartoons, saying he did not want their feelings hurt.Virginie, 15, said Paty showed the cartoons every year as part of a discussion about freedom following the Charlie Hebdo attack."},

Transmitted via parasite, it\u2019s almost as old as humanity and still exacts a heavy disease burden today: There were about 228 million malaria cases and 405,000 deaths worldwide in 2018.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nHydroxychloroquine and a related compound chloroquine have been used for decades to treat malaria, as well as autoimmune disorders lupus and rheumatoid arthritis AFP/GERARD JULIEN\n                            \n\n                    \n                Since 1955, global programs to eradicate malaria, assisted by the use of DDT and chloroquine, brought some success, but the disease is still endemic in many countries of the Global South.Similarly, diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and measles have been with us for several millennia. And despite all efforts, immediate eradication is still not in sight.Add to this mix relatively younger pathogens, such as HIV and Ebola virus, along with influenza and coronaviruses including SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19, and the overall epidemiological picture becomes clear.Research on the global burden of disease finds that annual mortality caused by infectious diseases \u2013 most of which occurs in the developing world \u2013 is nearly one-third of all deaths globally.READ: Commentary: COVID-19 is worsening the middle income trapREAD: Commentary: This is the face of Generation COVID-19Today, in an age of global air travel, climate change and ecological disturbances, we are constantly exposed to the threat of emerging infectious diseases while continuing to suffer from much older diseases that remain alive and well.Once added to the repertoire of pathogens that affect human societies, most infectious diseases are here to stay.READ: Commentary: The truth behind returning wildlife is less feel-good than you thinkPLAGUE STILL AROUNDEven infections that now have effective vaccines and treatments continue to take lives.Perhaps no disease can help illustrate this point better than plague, the single most deadly infectious disease in human history. Its name continues to be synonymous with horror even today.Plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. There have been countless local outbreaks and at least three documented plague pandemics over the last 5,000 years, killing hundreds of millions of people.READ: Commentary: The turning point in global fight against COVID-19 is approachingThe most notorious of all pandemics was the Black Death of the mid-14th century.Yet the Black Death was far from being an isolated outburst. Plague returned every decade or even more frequently, each time hitting already weakened societies and taking its toll during at least six centuries.Even before the sanitary revolution of the 19th century, each outbreak gradually died down over the course of months and sometimes years as a result of changes in temperature, humidity and the availability of hosts, vectors and a sufficient number of susceptible individuals.Some societies recovered relatively quickly from their losses caused by the Black Death. Others never did.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFILE PHOTO: Re-enactors recreate a scene showing a funeral during the Black Death plague during the Medieval Mdina Festival in Mdina, Malta's former capital city, May 8, 2011.

The cumulative effects of declining populations became impossible to recoup.It led to the gradual decline of the Mamluk Sultanate and its conquest by the Ottomans within less than two centuries.That very same state-wrecking plague bacterium remains with us even today, a reminder of the very long persistence and resilience of pathogens.READ: Commentary: Why is anyone still talking about herd immunity?Hopefully COVID-19 will not persist for millennia. But until there\u2019s a successful vaccine, and likely even after, no one is safe.Politics here are crucial: When vaccination programs are weakened, infections can come roaring back. Just look at measles and polio, which resurge as soon as vaccination efforts falter.Given such historical and contemporary precedents, humanity can only hope that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 will prove to be a tractable and eradicable pathogen.

That a growing number of Never Trump Republicans will also vote for him. But that\u2019s not enough to ensure victory.Joe Biden will not win this race choosing a traditional VP choice which appeals superficially to independents and Republicans.The key to victory for the 2020 Biden campaign is to get out the vote with three demographics that include a whopping 4 million voters who did not come out in 2016:\u00a0 African Americans, youths and suburban college-educated white women.

Little downside exists in doubling down on the record of the Obama Administration in choosing the former First Lady for the 2020 ticket to send that message.The Biden-Obama combination would also shift the 2020 election dynamic from the negative implications of a Trump era referendum to a positive and forward-facing campaign of optimism for a brighter future.\u00a0Michelle Obama\u2019s 2016 mantra in the face of partisan attacks of \u201cwhen they go low, we go high,\u201d would appeal to those voters tired of Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric by her bringing a positive message to the campaign.A BIDEN-OBAMA TICKET FAR-FETCHED, BUT TOTALLY?The question may be less about who the VP nominee should be and whether Michelle Obama would accept if asked.Even her most fervent fans have come to accept that she and her husband earned a respite from the rigours of politics and an opportunity to enjoy this new chapter in their life.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFormer U.S. President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama react to the crowd during an unveiling ceremony for their portraits at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, U.S., February 12, 2018.

The conservative Heritage Foundation\u2019s study also found little fraud.Any candidate could sow discord with attempts to impugn election integrity, but the one with the loudest voice already has a head start.At the Republican National Convention in August, the President said: \u201cThe only way they can take this election away from us is if this is a rigged election\u201d. Since April 2020, he has regularly linked mail-in voting to fraud in Facebook and Twitter posts.Trump has a longer history of questioning elections.In 2016, when his rival Senator Ted Cruz won the Iowa caucuses, an early step in the race for his party\u2019s nomination for president, Trump said it was because Cruz cheated.\u00a0Though Trump won in 2016 through an electoral college victory, he lost the popular vote. He said, without evidence, that was because of millions of illegal votes for Hillary Clinton \u2014 by non-citizens or those voting twice.He famously said that he would accept the results of the 2016 election \u2014 if he won.

They help voters evaluate their source.Adding context with labels is the most a social network can justify doing.PREMATURE VICTORY DECLARATIONSElection results are only official when state officials certify them days or weeks later.However, Americans can usually be confident of the results on election night, when precincts \u00a0announce vote tallies and news media project the winners.Under some states\u2019 laws, mailed-in ballots cannot be counted until election day, so observers have been predicting for months that accurate election night projections will be impossible this year.Americans may have to endure an election week or election month before winners are known.Zuckerberg told the New York Times its platforms would attempt to educate voters that nothing is wrong with such scenarios.Surveys show that far more Democrats than Republicans intend to vote by mail.Some predict a \u201cred mirage\u201d: Partial tallies on election night, mostly of in-person votes, may show Republicans in the lead. A \u201cblue shift\u201d may follow: When all ballots are counted, Democrats who were trailing may win.As the numbers change, some may cry foul.Facebook says it will flag any premature announcements of victory with labels saying that official results are not in yet.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS\u00a0President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference following June's midterm US\u00a0congressional elections at the White House in Washington.

It meant that the\u00a0law remained contested\u00a0and that Republican controlled state-level governments, such as\u00a0Texas\u00a0with its large uninsured population, did not cooperate with implementing key aspects of Obamacare.\u00a0When Republicans took control of the White House and both chambers of Congress in January 2017, the outlook for the preservation of Obamacare looked bleak.But despite\u00a0Trump\u2019s promises\u00a0to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the ACA, it is still the law of the land as his first term draws to a close.\u00a0READ: Commentary: How much will COVID-19 lockdowns slow the effects of climate change?In 2017, the Republican-led House\u00a0passed the American Health Care Act, which would have repealed large parts of the ACA.\u00a0Although the Republican leadership bent all the Senate\u2019s norms to breaking point,\u00a0no equivalent legislation passed in the upper house\u00a0and Obamacare remained.\u00a0In fact, the Republican efforts to undo the law seem to have been central to a growth in popularity for the ACA.\u00a0Throughout Obama\u2019s time in office, a plurality of Americans said that they viewed the law unfavourably, but that\u00a0shifted once\u00a0it came under sustained threat and reports emerged of how many people\u00a0would lose insurance\u00a0should it be repealed.\u00a0It also became clear that the sheer complexity of the law made it difficult to unravel if Republicans were to keep in place its popular aspects, notably protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFILE PHOTO: A sign on an insurance store advertises Obamacare in San Ysidro, San Diego, California, U.S., October 26, 2017.

So far, so environmentally good.But the\u00a0CPP quickly caused consternation with governors in dozens of states, who lost no time in taking legal action against a plan they viewed as a serious threat to the economy.\u00a0By early 2016,\u00a024 states were challenging\u00a0the CPP in court, resulting in a Supreme Court decision to issue a\u00a0judicial stay\u00a0on Obama\u2019s plan.When Trump arrived in the White House, the path to undermining the plan was already paved.In March 2017, he signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0requesting that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) carry out a review of the CPP.\u00a0READ:\u00a0Firefighters make headway in California wine country, 'gigafire' reaches 1 million acresREAD:\u00a0Commentary: Let Singapore\u2019s green spaces grow wildBy this time, the agency was headed by former Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt, known for his\u00a0rejection of the climate crisis\u00a0as a man-made phenomenon.\u00a0In June 2017, the US formally withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement, and four months later, the EPA announced that the CPP would be repealed.\u00a0These two developments were directly connected, as the CPP was a route via which the US would have met its modest Paris emissions targets.\u00a0With both Obama-era legacies unpicked, the Trump administration moved towards implementing its own, far more polluter-friendly option, the\u00a0Affordable Clean Energy\u00a0plan.\u00a0In keeping with his repeal and replace approach to Obama policy, Trump\u2019s plan did not place limits on greenhouse gases, an aim that was central to the CPP.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nDonald Trump will be the guest of honor at a state dinner -- a privilege also afforded to George W.

A deal may not be reached until early 2021.That's going to be too late for some.SAVINGS DRY UP\n    AdvertisementDirect cash payments and enhanced unemployment benefits established by the CARES Act, which added US$600 a week to state unemployment benefits, lifted more Americans out of poverty in April even as unemployment soared, according to research\u00a0by the Center on Poverty & Social Policy at Columbia University.People receiving the enhanced benefits were able to spend more, build savings and pay off debt, according to an analysis by the JPMorgan Chase Institute.But after the benefits expired at the end of July, poverty is once again on the rise - with the monthly poverty rate reaching 16.7 per cent in September from 15 per cent in February, according to the Columbia study. After a decade of decline, hunger is rising nationwide.Lisandra Bonilla, 46, saved roughly a third of the enhanced unemployment benefits she received after she was furloughed in late March from her job at an employment agency in Kissimmee, Florida. \"I had saved a lot because I didn't know what was going to happen,\" she said.\n        \n            \n            \n                        \n\n\n\nSeven months into crisis, millions of Americans face financial devastation\n                \n        It was smart planning: In August her benefits were cut to US$275 a week before taxes, the maximum in Florida, down from more than US$800.Bonilla returned to work part-time in late September, but now she is struggling to pay the bills on half her previous pay, and fears her savings will be gone by December.If she isn't hired full time soon, she needs to find another job.\"We're trying to shovel ourselves out of the hole, but at the same time the hole is getting bigger,\" said Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Two factors are particularly worrying, she said. More than 420,000 small businesses shuttered between March and mid-summer, which is more than three times the typical pace, she estimates. And permanent layoffs are also on the rise, hitting 3.8 million in September from 1.3 million in February - similar to levels seen before the 2008 election.THE LONGTERM UNEMPLOYMENT TRAPBishop Donald Harper has been on more than 50 job interviews since he was furloughed in March.Harper, 55, a veteran chef, most recently oversaw five restaurants at an Orlando resort. But with occupancy still low, it's not clear when he'll get back to work.Applications for jobs at super markets or in health care have also been fruitless.\"I can do anything and everything,\" said Harper, who also serves as a bishop for a non-denominational church. He is struggling to pay for food and utilities on US$275-a-week unemployment, and three months behind on his US$1,900 a month rent.\"I don't want to be homeless,\" said Harper, who lives with two children ages 10 and 13. He has reached out to more than 20 groups seeking rental assistance, with no luck.The United States has 2.4 million and growing \"long-term\" unemployed, officially defined as those who have been out of work for 27 weeks or more. Getting everyone back to work is crucial, but economists say these job seekers are at greater risk of dropping out of the labor market or taking lower paying jobs.This week, the US\u00a0Commerce Department is expected to report that Gross Domestic Product surged in the third quarter, thanks in part to fiscal stimulus that kept US\u00a0workers afloat, but has mostly expired.Now, people who are out of work or in low-wage jobs need rental support, direct cash payments and food assistance, as well as federal jobs projects and retraining programs, labor economists say.READ:\u00a0US early voting tops 70 million, continuing historic paceIf elected, Biden has pledged to raise the federal minimum wage, and roll out trillions of dollars in infrastructure and green energy programs.

She hasn't paid rent since June, and is still waiting to hear from the county government about a grant.\"I'm going to keep my head up, because if shit like this ever happens to my children I want them to keep their head up too,\" said Alvarez."},

It is our psychic need for such a person in the first place.His election might reacquaint the US with politics as it should be and has been: A machine for the arbitration of conflicting claims, and not as the basis of one\u2019s whole identity.READ: Commentary: Is Trumpism a cult?READ: Commentary: US presidential election will be closer than polls suggestIt is hard to convey the coolness \u2013 in truth, the resentment \u2013 with which Mr Biden\u2019s candidacy was met by many Democrats upon its launch 18 months ago. After their long tryst with Mr Obama, there was something bathetic about the man from Wilmington.The urge to worship a leader is often framed as rightwing, and the Trump base is unsurpassed in its intensity. But the itch is ultimately cross-partisan.It was not conservatives who made West Wing, the syrupy television drama about a near saint of a Democratic president. It was not conservatives who built the now faltering cult of the Kennedys.Mr Biden is the corrective to an unhealthy trend in his party and country. Nothing commends him to national leadership as much as the mild feelings that he arouses.Whatever enthusiasm has achieved this past decade or so, it is not an America at peace with itself."},

Eight days later her mother passed away.Now a new immigration order issued by President Donald Trump on Monday that bars the entry of holders of certain temporary work visas, could leave Dixit trapped in India, far from her children, until at least the end of the year.\"I've already lost my mother and I am being kept away from my motherhood as well,\" Dixit, who is staying with relatives in the outskirts of Mumbai, told Reuters. \"At this point my brain is just a fog.\"\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementDixit is one of nearly 1,000 people in India trapped in similar situations who joined a private group on the messaging app Telegram.Many like her have lived and worked in the United States legally for years but were in India when Trump made his announcement on Monday.

But she fears the separation will cause long-term psychological damage, especially for her younger daughter, who has grown frustrated with the phone calls. Her older daughter wrote above a family portrait on the fridge, \"living sadly ever after.\"\"COLLATERAL DAMAGE\"The White House said the visa measure is necessary to make jobs available for Americans when millions are out of work due to the pandemic.

He, too, was not able to get to a visa appointment before the consulate shuttered and is now stranded.\"It feels so unfair,\" Albuquerque told Reuters. \"We understand maybe something like this for new H-1Bs that have never been to the U.S., but people like us are collateral damage.\"\"I still contribute to the economy, I am still being taxed in the U.S.,\" he said."},

Formal declaration of the winner does not occur on election night.THREE LIKELY ELECTION NIGHT OUTCOMESPresuming Biden wins by at least a five-point margin, his lead now holds at 7.5 per cent, he would more than double Clinton\u2019s nearly 3 million vote victory in the popular vote last time, three scenarios await.Such a large margin nationally could correspond with a Biden a victory in the Electoral College with his taking back more traditional blue states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, plus picking-up swing states such as Florida and North Carolina.Or, with Trump losing by an even larger margin in core blue states such as California and New York coupled with a narrow win in Texas, and again eking out victories with razor-thin margins in places like Michigan and Wisconsin, he would earn a second clear Electoral College win even while losing by a much greater vote count overall.That scenario remains very much in play. Despite COVID-19, during one week in August alone the Trump campaign knocked on 1 million doors to turn out and deepen his base. In contrast, the Biden campaign knocked on none. The Trump campaign executes on their strategy despite the public health implications.The coronavirus contest could result in a third scenario. Trump could declare victory based on the in-person vote counts announced on election night if he were ahead, a plausible scenario given the majority of in-person votes could be from Republicans given Democrats are heeding the call to vote by mail.Trump campaign lawyers will undoubtedly mount vigorous challenges in key states that will dwarf efforts to question mail and absentee ballots as happened during the Florida 2000 recount, an effort which ended-up with the Supreme Court in effect determining the outcome of the election weeks later.THE UGLIEST, MOST CONTENTIOUS ELECTION EVERIf Biden wins by such a clear margin in the Electoral College by taking back the traditional blue states lost by Clinton and also winning Arizona, Florida and North Carolina, his victory should be accepted, regardless of what Trump says or does.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nDemocratic U.S. presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at a meeting with steel workers at a backyard during his visit to Detroit, Michigan, September 9, 2020.

In particular, the Biden campaign wants a turnout so large his vote totals perform outside the \u201cmargin of lawyers\u201d.Historians refer to the election of 1876, the last time the person with an outright majority of votes did not become President, as \u201cthe ugliest, most contentious presidential election ever\u201d.Let\u2019s hope it stays that way.Steven R Okun and Thurgood Marshall Jr served in the Clinton administration as Deputy General Counsel at the Department of Transportation and White House Cabinet Secretary, respectively.

Watch closely: It may be a harbinger of things to come, as the world's smaller countries respond to the increasingly coercive Asian economic superpower.For years, the Australian political and business establishment had a paramount goal: Protect and expand this natural resource powerhouse's booming exports to fast-growing China.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementIron ore, coal, natural gas, wine and more: Until COVID-19 struck, Australia had a 29-year run without a single recession as it sent its signature goods to the world's voracious number two economy. Canberra's diplomacy came to focus on balancing the Chinese trade relationship with the nation's equally important defence alliance with the United States.But the paradigm through which the government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison now views China has shifted dramatically, people inside his government told Reuters. The relationship is no longer shaped just by trade, but by a stark view emerging widely inside this continent-spanning country \u2013 that Beijing poses a threat to Australia's democracy and national sovereignty.Discussions about China inside Morrison's cabinet now revolve around the need to preserve sovereignty and fend off Chinese efforts to sway Australian politics, two government sources told Reuters.Recent steps taken by the prime minister appear to reflect this thinking. He has warned the Australian public about a significant increase in cyberattacks, introduced a national security test for foreign investments, and announced a dramatic jump in defence spending focused on the Indo-Pacific region. Morrison did not name China when announcing these moves, but government officials said they came in response to Beijing's actions.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementAustralia has also voiced concerns in recent weeks about what it sees as Chinese disinformation campaigns that seek to undermine democracies; suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong over China's imposition of a\u00a0security law in the city; and filed a declaration with the United Nations rejecting China's maritime claims in the South China Sea.Of all the actions taken by Australia in recent months, though, it is the government's lobbying of world leaders in April for an inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic that has most enraged Beijing.The world lined up behind the move, with 137 nations co-sponsoring a resolution at the World Health Assembly for an investigation into the pandemic, which first emerged in Wuhan. Beijing also ultimately backed the resolution. An independent panel, headed by former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, will deliver an interim report in November.Beijing lashed out angrily, imposing trade sanctions on Australia after the pandemic inquiry move. It suspended some beef imports on a technicality and effectively blocked a US$439 million trade in barley by slapping tariffs of 80.5 per cent on the Australian import. China has also launched an anti-dumping probe into Australian wine imports.\n    AdvertisementREAD:\u00a0Commentary: Why China is turning sour on Australia winesIn August, a Chinese diplomat drew on Roman history to blast Canberra, comparing Australia's call for an inquiry to the betrayal of Julius Caesar by the assassin Brutus.READ:\u00a0China warns of 'shadow' over ties with Australia, tells it to stop 'whining'China's foreign ministry said Beijing had never interfered in Australia or used coercion against it. Responding to questions from Reuters, the ministry also called on Australia to \"abandon the Cold War mentality\",\u00a0do more to \"enhance mutual trust\" and not \"provoke trouble on issues involving China's core interests\". A stable relationship, it said, was in the interests of both countries.Reuters spoke to 19 current and former Australian government officials and two former prime ministers in examining how relations with China have deteriorated. They provided the first comprehensive account of how the government came to adopt its view that Australia must \"speak up\", as several ministers have said, about Beijing's actions.This shift in Australia's position on China began in 2017, the interviews show, before the sharp deterioration in relations between Beijing and Washington, which threatens to trigger a new Cold War. The change has been led in part by a coterie of Australian officials, some with security and intelligence backgrounds, who hold deeply sceptical views of the Chinese leadership and its global ambitions.In one sign of the times, a bipartisan group of anti-China hawks has formed in the Australian parliament, who dub themselves \"the Wolverines\".Asked about this shift, Morrison couched his moves with diplomatic care. In a written response to questions from Reuters, he said his government's approach to China has been consistent.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nAustralia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison speaks to the media during a news conference in Sydney, Australia, Jul 27, 2020.

The stakes are high: Australia has a US$172 billion trading relationship with China, and a US$51 billion surplus.It is an uneasy balancing act. In response to Australia's push for a pandemic inquiry, Beijing accused Canberra of \"dancing to the tune\" of Washington. In June, after a fresh threat from Beijing on trade, Morrison said Australia would not yield to \"coercion\".A visit Morrison paid to Beijing in 2017, when he was Treasurer, set the stage for his stance in the current feud. He came away from the trip convinced his country's trade with the world's second largest economy had two-way benefit. He had heard from Chinese officials, he told a small group of reporters in Beijing at the time, that Australia's exports of iron ore, which the country produces in vast volumes and high quality, put it in a \"unique position\".This conviction, that China needs Australia's iron ore, is now buttressing his government's position.\"It is a mutually beneficial relationship,\" Morrison said in his comments to Reuters. \"China's economy is stronger because they have access to high quality energy, resources, agricultural goods and increasingly services from Australia. And our economy is stronger because we have access to high quality manufactured goods from China.\"So far, China has not mentioned iron ore as a potential target for reprisal. For good reason: Australia makes up 60 per cent of China's imports of iron ore, crucial for powering an economy Beijing is trying to get back to full capacity after it was shuttered by the virus.Despite China's \"bluster\", it needs Australia, says former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, whose relationship with Beijing became increasingly icy during his tenure from 2015 to 2018.\"If China suddenly came across a huge supply of iron ore, at appropriate grades, that they could extract at competitive prices, that was closer to them, they would be all over it \u2013 but there's not,\" he told Reuters. \"Chinese companies do not buy Australian commodities, goods or services because they want to do this struggling little island nation a favour \u2013 they do it because it's good value, good quality.\"\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFile photo of a\u00a0miner holding a lump of iron ore at a mine located in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, Dec 2, 2013.

China hopes Australia will \"do more\" that is \"conducive to friendly exchanges and cooperation\",\u00a0the ministry said.It remains to be seen whether Australia's tougher stance provides a broader model for other mid-sized powers reliant on exports to China, however. Australia's iron ore would be hard for China to replace; other nations may lack such leverage.One former Australian leader, while supporting a firm position on China, questions the government's handling of the relationship.Former Labour Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said China is difficult to deal with and respects strength, but he is critical of the Morrison government's \"rolling crises\" with Beijing. Being \"hairy-chested on China\" has become a competition for advancement in Morrison's Liberal Party, Rudd told Reuters.\"China is never going to impose any economic measures against Australia which damage its own interests,\" said Rudd, a fluent Mandarin speaker and former diplomat in the Beijing embassy. But, he adds, Australia has vulnerabilities: Australian exports beyond iron ore that are not essential to China could be targeted by Beijing, quickly adding up to an expensive toll.\"The atmosphere in Australia does not lend itself to a reasoned discussion on the China relationship, because you are automatically defined as either a hawk or a panda hugger,\" Rudd said in an interview.SOURED SENTIMENTWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Australia had already decided it was dealing with a more authoritarian and assertive Chinese government under Xi Jinping, and in the long-term needed to reduce its trade reliance on Beijing, diplomats and government officials told Reuters.The pandemic brought tensions into the open like never before, however. In previous bouts of friction, too, Beijing took punitive economic measures against Australia. But those penalties, such as holding up coal shipments or wine at its ports, were cloaked as customs technicalities.This time, China's ambassador to Canberra, Cheng Jingye, was unequivocal, threatening in an Apr\u00a027 newspaper interview that in response to Australia's call for an inquiry, the Chinese public could boycott Australian wine, beef and tourism.READ:\u00a0Australia will not be 'intimidated' amid China economic threats: PM Scott MorrisonREAD:\u00a0COVID-19: China warns students to think twice before choosing Australia due to racist incidentsBeijing then cautioned its students against choosing Australian universities, threatening a US$27.5 billion market for educating foreign students. Morrison fired back with his strongest language on China since becoming prime minister.\"We are an open-trading nation, mate, but I'm never going to trade our values in response to coercion from wherever it comes,\" he told Sydney radio station 2GB in June.Public sentiment toward China has soured. An annual poll by the Lowy Institute, a foreign policy research group, found that trust in China among Australians had plummeted to 23 per cent, compared with 52 per cent in 2018. The survey, released in June, found that 94 per cent of respondents supported reducing economic reliance on China.The government's approach of working with other nations in the region to deal with China enjoys bipartisan support. \"In our relationship with China, as with any country, we must always assert our values and our interests \u2013 including transparency and sovereignty,\" the opposition Labour Party's foreign affairs spokeswoman, Senator Penny Wong, told Reuters.The United States is Australia's major security ally. But with the election of Donald Trump on an \"America First\" platform, the officials who have pushed a tougher line on China have also called for Australia to begin seeking wider alliances with so-called middle powers \u2013 countries like Japan, India and Indonesia.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Indonesian President Joko Widodo meet before a discussion with ministers in the Cabinet Room at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, Feb 10, 2020.

Trump grew irate when Turnbull asked if Trump planned to honour an agreement with predecessor Barack Obama to accept 1,250 refugees held in Australian detention centres on Pacific islands.The US Embassy in Canberra declined to comment.THE ERA OF WIN-WINAustralia established diplomatic ties with communist China in 1972, seven years before the United States fully recognised the People's Republic of China.Trade links with Beijing grew as Australia shipped iron ore, coal and liquefied natural gas to China, fuelling the Chinese boom.The economic relationship peaked with the signing of a free trade agreement at the end of 2015 that lowered Chinese tariffs on agriculture, dairy and wine, and promised to open the door for Australian banking and other professional services to China's restricted market.But Australia was jolted within months of the signing when Beijing refused to recognise a 2016 international court ruling that China had no historical claim over disputed islands in the South China Sea. The Turnbull government joined Washington in rebuking China.Canberra was also becoming concerned by growing Chinese attempts at influence in Australia, particularly through political donations from Chinese businessmen to local politicians that had come to light.In December 2017, Turnbull introduced foreign interference laws to parliament. Among the activities the law aimed to curb were the Chinese Communist Party's covert influence over Chinese students on university campuses, interference by Beijing in local Chinese-language media, and attempts by China to shape decisions by Australian politicians, from local councils to federal members of parliament.READ:\u00a0Australia to probe foreign influence at universitiesA report on these and other Chinese activities prepared by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the country's national security agency, had \"galvanised us to take action\", Turnbull said at the time.Beijing reacted furiously to the foreign interference legislation and responded by freezing diplomatic visits. This included an end to annual leaders' visits.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nFile photo of the Australian and Chinese national flags.

The foreign ministry, which preferred a lower-key approach, was sidelined.Cyber intrusions were becoming a major concern. Alastair MacGibbon, Turnbull's special adviser on cyber security and former head of the Australian Cyber Security Centre, told Reuters that China was probing companies to gather intelligence about resources or investment areas to benefit its state-owned enterprises.READ:\u00a0China behind hack on parliament, political parties: Australia intelligence\"China has very significant capability, and was making strategic grabs of what competitors, friends and foes were doing,\" said MacGibbon, who is now the chief strategy officer at CyberCX, a private cyber security firm.China's foreign ministry said cyber attacks are hard to trace and Australia needed to show evidence of Beijing's involvement. \"In the absence of evidence, it is very irresponsible to unilaterally hype up cyberattack issues against other countries,\" the ministry said.RISE OF THE CHINA HAWKSIn August 2018, Australia became the first country to effectively ban Chinese tech giant Huawei from its next-generation 5G telecom network on national security grounds. Turnbull, who co-founded Australia's first major Internet service provider, explained the logic behind the move.\"If Huawei were to provide your 5G network, or a large portion, does that give Huawei the capability to disrupt large parts of your economy? The answer is yes,\" Turnbull told Reuters. \"Do you want to give a foreign state whose attitude to you may not always be benign the capability to inflict harm? The answer is no.\"Mike Burgess, then the head of the nation's technology intelligence agency, the Australian Signals Directorate, had advised Turnbull that the technology risk posed by Huawei could not be mitigated, Turnbull said. Burgess previously had worked at the defence intelligence base Pine Gap, a top secret US satellite tracking and missile launch detection station in the Australian desert. Burgess declined to comment.Australian security officials raised their concerns about Huawei with Washington, which followed Canberra's lead, imposing a ban on the Chinese firm in May last year. Officials also travelled to Britain to explain Australia's position. The British were focused on Russian interference, MacGibbon said, but the Australian officials argued they also needed to understand the risk from China.Having initially decided Huawei would be allowed a limited role in its 5G network, the UK government reversed course in July, announcing it would ban the company from the country's 5G network by ordering telecom firms to remove its equipment by 2027.Huawei Australia said it did not engage in any efforts to interfere in the country's telecommunication networks and was taken by surprise when Turnbull moved against the company.\"Up until that point we were in the process of competing for 5G business with all Australian network operators,\" Jeremy Mitchell, Huawei Australia's chief corporate affairs officer, told Reuters.China's foreign ministry said the Australian government banned Huawei \"under the pretext of national security without any factual basis\".\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFile photo of an Australian flag at its embassy in Beijing, China, Jan 24, 2019.

He has become a powerful voice on China policy in the prime minister's inner circle and has urged closer engagement with Japan and India, government sources told Reuters.In June, Australia sealed a strategic partnership with India that granted the two countries access to each other's military bases and allowed for Australia to provide India with rare earths, metals that are crucial to defence and space programs.Shearer worked in Washington at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), an influential defence and security think-tank, between 2016 and 2018. It was a time when attitudes towards Beijing were hardening among US Republicans and Democrats, said CSIS senior vice president for Asia, Michael Green.Appearing before the US House Committee on Armed Services in 2017, Shearer told members China was intent on undermining the liberal world order and the institutions that underpinned it.Shearer worked on issues including China's \"grey zone\" interference in the East and South China Seas \u2013 aggressive moves that stopped short of war, such as erecting and fortifying artificial islands. \"We were looking for ways to harness alliances and partnerships to deter Beijing from escalating further,\" said Green, who formerly served on the US\u00a0National Security Council.READ:\u00a0US targets Chinese individuals, companies amid South China Sea disputeThat thinking was evident in Morrison's recent announcement that Australia will boost defence spending by 40 per cent over the next decade.

It helps show China we are not alone in our concerns,\" said Maude, a former intelligence agency director-general, who left the department of foreign affairs last year. \"It is also a helpful rebuttal of China's narrative that Australia simply does what the United States asks of us.\"The sharpest public criticism of China has come from a bipartisan group of parliamentarians who call themselves the Wolverines, inspired by a group of teenagers who resist a Soviet invasion in the 1980s movie Red Dawn. The group, none of whom are in the Cabinet, coalesced in 2019.The most prominent Wolverine is former special forces soldier and Liberal Party lawmaker Andrew Hastie, who chairs parliament's intelligence oversight committee. In August last year, Hastie compared the West's approach to an authoritarian China to the failure of France to stop the advance of Nazi Germany.China's foreign ministry said that some Australian politicians and think-tanks had for some time been \"spreading rumours to discredit China and severely poisoning the atmosphere of bilateral relations\".Australia has pushed back against Chinese diplomats who object to public criticism of Beijing.

But publicly, Australian business leaders stayed largely quiet.Iron ore miners have also been largely restrained, as they continued to ship Australia's most valuable resource, extracted from the red, dry dirt of the Western Australian Pilbara region, to Chinese steel makers.In June, Australian iron ore shipments hit a record A$9.9 billion (US$7.2 billion), pushing annual exports past A$100 billion\u00a0for the first time, as the only rival supplier, Brazil's Vale, suffered COVID-19 shutdowns.\"China needs our commodities \u2013 we do have some of the best iron ore in the world. It does mean Australia comes from a position of strength,\" Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia chief executive Paul Everingham told Reuters. At the same time, he added, the iron ore industry is uncomfortable with the newly \"adversarial climate\".In the wake of the 2018 diplomatic freeze, the national security agency and the ministry of foreign affairs held briefings for executives in industries exposed to China. The executives have been told that complaining would provide ammunition to Beijing for propaganda against the Australian government, said an agriculture industry source. Companies were advised instead to work with Australian officials to comply with the minutiae of Chinese red tape and expose Beijing's trade retaliation for what it was.The government also told industry it was seeking alternative markets for Australian goods, had negotiated access to Indonesia, and was in talks with Britain, Europe and India.The muted response from the business community is in contrast to 2018, when chief executives complained loudly that the Turnbull government's dispute with China risked damaging trade, and implored him to fly to Beijing to fix it.\"So much of the Australian business community, faced with criticism or a difference of opinion between Australia and China, will side with China,\" Turnbull recalls of the situation he faced as prime minister. But, he adds, \"there has been an awakening\"."},

But, as COVID-19 infections rise and social tensions surface \u2013 exemplified by widespread protests over racial injustice and police violence \u2013 America\u2019s lawmakers have returned to their respective corners.As a result, progress on laying the foundations for long-term growth \u2013 including in areas where there appeared to be bipartisan agreement, such as infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, worker retraining and retooling \u2013 seems a more distant prospect.A similar disconnect between will and ability can be seen in America\u2019s monetary policy response. The Fed is willing to do whatever it can to limit the cyclical and structural damage to the labour market, which includes more than 46 million people who have filed for unemployment benefits.But it lacks both efficient tools and support from fiscal policymakers, who are better equipped to promote durable growth.With few options to promote genuine economic growth, the Fed has felt compelled to take previously unthinkable steps that are increasingly distorting the functioning of financial markets, thereby aggravating wealth inequality and encouraging excessive risk-taking by both debtors and investors.Instead of being part of the solution, the Fed is now at risk of creating more problems, including resource misallocation, debt overhangs and financial instability \u2013 all of which would undermine growth.DISCONNECT WITH GLOBAL TRADING SYSTEMIntention and outcome are also misaligned in international economic relations.In its bid to make the global trading system fairer, US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has pursued bilateral policies that have undermined trade flows.\u00a0The US is now the most protectionist of the advanced economies.More broadly, at a moment when multiplying global crises are demanding close coordination of individual and collective policy responses, the Trump administration has eschewed multilateralism.To some countries in Asia, in particular, its own policy has become increasingly unpredictable, fuelling doubts about the robustness and reliability of a global system that has the US at its core.China, for one, has hastened its efforts to deepen bilateral and regional linkages so that it can bypass the US, but at the cost of fragmenting the international system.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Beijing would prefer another term of Trump chaos to a Biden presidencyUS policymakers are divided on many issues, but surely they can agree on the desirability of faster, more inclusive and more durable growth.The only way to achieve this sustainably is to accompany short-term relief measures with forward-looking pro-growth and pro-work fiscal policies and structural reforms.Otherwise, potentially reversible short-term problems, such as high unemployment, could become deeply entrenched and much more difficult to address.For its part, the Fed must exercise more caution in how it intervenes in markets.By continuously expanding both the scale and reach of its asset-purchase programmes, it is stripping markets of their ability to price and allocate resources appropriately.\n        \n            \n            \n                        \n\nDonald Trump's attacks on China for its handling of the virus outbreak have fanned fears of another trade war between the economic superpowers AFP/JIM WATSON\n                \n        If it\u2019s not careful, the Fed could end up inadvertently pulling the rug out from under America\u2019s potent market-based system, propping up productivity-weakening zombie companies, and further reducing the likelihood that genuine economic growth would eventually validate elevated asset prices.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Ticket against Donald Trump in White House race missing boldest choiceFinally, US policymakers should work together to restore their country\u2019s global economic leadership, by reinvigorating multilateral policy discussions and improving the functioning of the rules-based global system.To this end, the US should revive stalled efforts to reform IMF and World Bank governance, including by bringing representation into line with today\u2019s economic realities and working to increase the Fund\u2019s resources.Other countries should not underestimate the importance of such changes for their own economic performance.No matter how big an economy is, it is likely to be influenced by US economic growth, international financial stability and monetary policy spill-overs.With the COVID-19 crisis, the evolution of the global economic-policy paradigm has become an urgent matter.The challenge for other countries now is to reduce America\u2019s \u201cexecution risk,\u201d by doing whatever they can at home to ensure self-reinforcing growth impulses and a fairer international system.Mohamed A El-Erian, Chief Economic Adviser at Allianz, was Chairman of US President Barack Obama\u2019s Global Development Council.

Fans gather online in communities to express support for their favourite acts in much the same way sports fans do, watching their idols\u2019 every move and cheering them on.\u00a0Before the coronavirus scuttled live events, those fans gathered offline to attend concerts and fan meetings, even showing up at the airport when a group was flying in or out of their city.READ: Commentary: How world sensation BTS took K-pop fandom to a whole new levelREAD: Commentary: Goo Hara\u2019s death should lead K-pop fans to do some soul-searchingTRUMP VS K-POPIdol music also prominently features messages of love.

First, Biden and Harris are more likely to win the election than more radical Democratic contenders would have been.Second, they will bolster the institutions that previously made America strong and restore its leadership in the world.

This has had a huge adverse impact, spawning populism around the world.To be sure, America\u2019s record of global engagement is not without blemish. In the 1960s and early 1970s, for example, it was on the wrong side of history several times \u2013 including in prosecuting the Vietnam War, tacitly supporting the overthrow of Chilean President Salvador Allende, and attempting to thwart Bangladeshi independence.\u00a0Fortunately, this coldly \u201crealist\u201d US foreign policy slowly gave way to one with some moral compass and global concern. The president who deserves the greatest credit for this shift is Jimmy Carter.\u00a0Although he was low-key and not good at politicking, Carter had the rare mettle \u2013 evident in his moving 2018 interview with The Late Show\u2019s Stephen Colbert \u2013 to be prepared to lose for a moral cause.A NEED FOR STRONG GLOBAL LEADERSHIPIn today\u2019s globalised world, we must recognise that all human beings, not just all co-nationals, are born equal. Hyper-nationalism is not only bad economics, but is also morally wrong.\u00a0I have no doubt that a time will come when we regard hyper-nationalism \u2013 the belief that one\u2019s compatriots are special and more deserving than others \u2013 the way we view racism today.READ: Trump formally nominated by Republicans, warns of 'rigged election' READ:\u00a0Commentary: This may be the most important US election everBecause we currently live in a world of nation-states, nationalism is unavoidable for now. But we need leaders who can pioneer an international mindset and help to build a better future for all of humanity, including the poor and dispossessed wherever they live.\u00a0This is the big responsibility that Biden and Harris must shoulder in seeking to re-establish the global leadership from which America has retreated under Trump.A LEAF OUT OF NEHRU'S BOOKOn the subject of internationalism, Biden and Harris may wish to consider the thoughts of India\u2019s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who spoke more eloquently about these values than perhaps any other leader.\u00a0Nehru fought for India\u2019s independence, in which nationalism was obviously a driving force.

But, a stage arrives when it might well have a narrowing influence...\u201dThat stage arrives, Nehru believed, because \u201cevery people suffer from the strange delusion that they are the elect and better than all others. When they become strong and powerful, they try to impose themselves and their ways on others,\u201d but eventually \u201coverreach themselves, stumble, and fall.\u201dNehru concluded with a warning to his newly independent country. \u201cWe, in India, have to be particularly careful of this ...\u00a0We have a tendency to fall into separate groups and to forget the larger unity.\u201dI shall leave it to Biden and Harris to substitute the US for India, and draw the lesson they may.

Sometimes it\u2019s a tricky intersection where townscape and countryside meet. Sometimes it\u2019s road hazards left from past accidents, like logging slash, invasive grasses or postburn environments.Climate change acts as a performance enhancer, and understandably, it claims most of the attention because it\u2019s global and its reach extends beyond flames to oceans, mass extinctions and other knock-on effects.But climate change is not enough by itself to account for the plague of megafires. Climate integrates many factors, and so does fire. Their interplay makes attribution tricky.HUMAN FIRESInstead, consider fire in all its manifestations as the informing narrative. The critical inflection in modern times occurred when humans began to burn fossilised rather than living biomass.That set into motion a \u201cpyric transition\u201d that resembles the demographic transition which accompanies industrialisation as human populations first expand, then recede. Something similar happens with the population of fires, as new ignition sources and fuels become available while old ones persist.READ: Commentary: Forget bamboo straws. Let\u2019s name the elephants in the room of Singapore\u2019s climate debateREAD: Commentary: To combat climate change, investors should keep their shares in fossil fuelsIn the US, the transition sparked a wave of monster fires that rode the rails of settlement \u2013 fires an order of magnitude larger and more lethal than those of recent decades. Land clearing and logging slash fed serial conflagrations, which blew up in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the waning decades of the Little Ice Age.It was a period of flame-catalysed havoc that inspired state-sponsored conservation and a determination to eliminate free-burning flame. Led by foresters, the belief spread that fire on landscapes could be caged, as it was in furnaces and dynamos.Eventually, as technological substitution (think of replacing candles with lightbulbs) and active suppression reduced the presence of open flame, the population of fires fell to the point where fire could no longer do the ecological work required.Meanwhile, society reorganised itself around fossil fuels, adapting to the combustion of lithic landscapes and ignoring the fire latent in living ones.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nFile photo of industrial emissions.

Fuels in the living landscape pile up and rearrange themselves. The climate is unhinged. When flame returns, as it must, it comes as wildfire.WELCOME TO THE PYROCENEWiden the aperture a bit, and we can envision Earth entering a fire age comparable to the ice ages of the Pleistocene, complete with the pyric equivalent of ice sheets, pluvial lakes, periglacial outwash plains, mass extinctions, and sea level changes. It\u2019s an epoch in which fire is both prime mover and principal expression.Even climate history has become a subset of fire history. Humanity\u2019s firepower underwrites the Anthropocene, which is the outcome not just of human meddling but of a particular kind of meddling through humanity\u2019s species monopoly over fire.The interaction of these two realms of fire has not been much studied. It\u2019s been a stretch to fully include human fire practices within traditional ecology.READ: Commentary: Things you love that are being wrecked by climate changeBut industrial fire, unlike landscape fires, is solely a product of human finagling, and so has stood outside the bounds of ecological science. It\u2019s as though the intellectual sink for understanding can no more hold the new realm of burning than nature can its emissions.FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIREYet in humanity \u2013 the keystone species for fire on Earth \u2013 those two arenas of earthly burning, like smoke from separate fires drawn into a single convective column, are merging.\u00a0In the developed world, industrial combustion arranges agriculture, built environments, peri-urban settings and reserves for wildlands \u2013 all the stuff available for landscape fire.

While some wildlife could be emboldened by our absence, in most cases, these animals are searching for food.With disruption in public activity, usual sources of food for urbanised wildlife may suddenly become less available. Naturally, they start roaming a larger territory in search of food, probably helped by reduced human traffic and city noise.\n    AdvertisementSuch stories are a welcome distraction at this time, but they are not unique to a world in pandemic.

As with every shared living environment, conflict may sometimes seem inevitable \u2013 just ask the people who we\u2019ve been cooped up with at home.A typical reaction to the presence of wildlife in our living environment is \u201cNot in my backyard!\u201d Wildlife encounters have been met with hostility.In Singapore, snakes have been beaten to death simply for being in a garden. Elsewhere, elephants have been poisoned for venturing into plantations, raiding and trampling crops.But while we discuss the phenomena of returning wildlife, we risk ignoring a larger irony. Wildlife in urban environments may be a passing curiosity, but human encroachment on wildlife habitat is the very reason we are in lockdown battling the COVID-19 pandemic.There is considerable speculation about the origins of COVID-19 but scientists are certain it is a zoonotic disease, caused by a human being coming into contact with an animal, whether a bat or another animal that carried the coronavirus.READ: Wuhan lab had three live bat coronaviruses: Chinese state mediaREAD: Commentary: What's really behind the China coronavirus cover-up theoryLINK TO ZOONOTIC DISEASESCloser and more frequent contact with wildlife increases the spillover of pathogens from wildlife to humans.Previous pandemics have started in similar ways: Whether due to wild meat consumption (ebola); direct interaction with live wildlife; intermediate hosts such as civets (SARS), or domestic animals such as poultry (avian influenza).With its suspected origins in a wildlife market, COVID-19 is no exception.Tropical forests are home to millions of species including microbes and host animals. When intact, they act as a buffer protecting us from zoonotic\u00a0diseases.When these forests are destroyed, this natural buffer disappears. It is no surprise then that a\u00a0third of emerging infectious diseases are linked to deforestation.In spite of the knowledge we have about the impacts of deforestation, 16 million hectares of forest are cut down annually with no sign of a slowdown.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nCharred trunks are seen on a tract of Amazon jungle, that was recently burned by loggers and farmers, in Porto Velho, Brazil Aug\u00a023, 2019.\u00a0(Photo: REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino)\n                            \n\n                    \n                From Southeast Asia to Brazil, we are clearing land to feed our demand for timber, soy, palm oil, beef and rubber. Likewise in Singapore and many growing cities, we clear land to make way for roads and buildings.Put bluntly, our staggering assault on nature may have created an infectious disease breeding ground over which we have no control.ROLE OF WILDLIFE TRADEPandemic risk is linked not just to habitat loss, but also to the exploitation of wildlife for trade and consumption.How exactly COVID-19 was transmitted remains uncertain. What\u2019s certain though, is that wildlife trade brings together animals (dead or alive) of varying species and sources into close proximity, especially in wildlife markets.READ: Commentary: Singapore\u2019s ivory trade ban tackles elephant in room but work ahead a mammoth taskWeak to no enforcement of laws in these markets, coupled with the absence of any veterinary controls, increase the risk of pathogens being transmitted to humans.The illegal wildlife trade affects more than 7,000 animal and plant species worldwide. As a global transhipment hub, Singapore has inadvertently facilitated the illegal trade of wildlife.Over 2019, Singapore authorities seized an unprecedented amount of pangolin scales and elephant ivory, worth more than S$170 million in total. A few of the seizures that year were among the largest the world has seen.READ: Singapore seizes record haul of ivory alongside pangolin scales in S$66m shipmentAllowing illegal wildlife trade to continue sets up a lose-lose situation for us: The loss of biodiversity, and increased transmission risk of new viruses anywhere along illegal trade routes.A CHANCE TO BUILD SOMETHING BETTERMany are asking how life will look like after the pandemic.

Only with strong legislation and effective enforcement can we protect our remaining natural spaces.Striking a balance between development needs and protecting nature has never been an easy choice in Singapore.But our experience with this pandemic must teach us that nature is intrinsic to our survival and economic welfare and must be a cornerstone for any development planning.In Singapore and beyond, we need to demand for the sustainable production of commodities like palm oil, rubber, soy, pulp and paper. This ensures the products we use are deforestation-free and not made at the expense of the natural environment.READ: COVID-19: Why saving our forests can help stop the next pandemicREAD: Commentary: Saving the orangutans shouldn't be this complicatedSecond, where poaching and consumption of wildlife still thrive, we must crack down on illegal trade and close unregulated markets.Recognising the origin of COVID-19, China declared\u00a0on Feb 24 a comprehensive ban on wildlife trade and the consumption of wild animals.In Singapore, we applaud the recent changes to the now renamed Wildlife Act, which strengthens protection of local wildlife by addressing threats such as the poaching and feeding of wildlife.This must come together with a move to shut down transnational illegal trade via Singapore\u2019s ports and airport.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA view of public housing\u00a0blocks, with solar panels affixed to the roof of some blocks, in Singapore on Jun\u00a027, 2019.

For instance, the global US$2.5 trillion agriculture sector is dependent on pollination, water quality and a stable climate.COVID-19 has brought carbon-intensive industries to a grinding halt \u2013 we can make use of this momentum by shifting investments to and creating new jobs in sustainable businesses.Here in Southeast Asia, the shift has already begun. Clean energy industries in this region could create up to 2.2 million jobs by 2030.READ: Commentary: That low-carbon future for Singapore isn\u2019t so far-fetchedREAD: Commentary: Reaching net-zero emissions will be \u2018very challenging\u2019.

If the US technology giants are broken up, the result would be a vastly uneven global playing field, pitting fragmented US companies against consolidated state-protected Chinese firms.PRICE ISN\u2019T KEYThere are two main views of antitrust action among legal experts.One focuses on consumer welfare, which has been the prevailing approach federal lawyers have taken since the 1960s.The other suggests that regulators should look at the underlying structure of the market and potential for powerful players to exploit their positions.READ: Commentary: Big Tech is showing some love to the US government \u2013 which comes as no surpriseREAD: Commentary: Help, I love tech monopolies!Those two sides seem to agree that price plays a key role. People who argue against breaking up the tech giants point out that Facebook and Google provide services that are free to the consumer, and that Amazon\u2019s marketplace power drives its products\u2019 costs down.On the other side, though, are those who say that having low or no prices is evidence that these companies are artificially lowering consumer costs to draw users into company-controlled systems that are hard to leave.Both sides are missing the fact that the monetary price is less relevant as a measure of what users pay in the technology industry than it is in other types of business. Users pay for digital products with their data, rather than just money.Regulators shouldn\u2019t focus only on the monetary costs to the users. Rather, they should ask whether users are being asked for more data than is strictly necessary, whether information is being collected in intrusive or abusive ways and whether customers are getting good value in exchange for their data.READ: Commentary: Facebook\u2019s decision to resist advertiser boycott could pay off in the long runTHE BEST OUTCOME IS IN THE MIDDLEThere aren\u2019t just two ways for this debate to end, with either a breakup of one or more technology giants or simply leaving things as they are for the market to develop further.In my view, the best outcome is right in the middle.

That is exactly what happened in past cases against the Bell System, IBM and Microsoft.In the 1956 federal consent decree against the Bell System telephone company, for example, which settled a seven-year legal saga, the company wasn\u2019t split up. Instead, Bell was required to license all its patents royalty-free to other businesses.This meant that some of the most profound technological innovations in history \u2013 including the transistor, the solar cell and the laser \u2013 became widely available, yielding computers, solar power and other technologies that are crucial to the modern world.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Artificial intelligence and automation would actually benefit SingaporeREAD:\u00a0Commentary: The next tech crash is around the corner thanks to COVID-19When the Bell System was eventually broken up in 1982, it did not do nearly as much to spread innovation and competition as the agreement that kept the Bells together a quarter-century earlier.The antitrust action against IBM lasted 13 years and didn\u2019t break up the company. However, as part of its tactics to avoid appearing to be a monopoly, IBM agreed to separate pricing for its hardware and software products, previously sold as an indivisible bundle.This created an opportunity for entrepreneurs Bill Gates and Paul Allen to create a new software-only company called Microsoft. The surge of software innovations that have followed can clearly trace their origins to the IBM settlement.Two decades later, Microsoft was itself the target of an antitrust action.

And yet, both parties approached their conventions with outsized ambition.Last week\u2019s all-virtual Democratic convention was generally well received.

But President Trump enters this final lap of the campaign with high disapproval numbers and needs the convention to help him define 2020 as a choice rather than a referendum.\n    AdvertisementTrump\u2019s natural impulse is to define that choice through personal attacks and fear-mongering. That impulse is likely to dominate the Republican convention, given that the party declined to adopt a new policy platform for 2020 (other than asserting their enthusiastic support for the president and his agenda).\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle, the National Chair of the \"Trump Victory Finance Committee\" and girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., delivers a pre-recorded speech to the largely virtual 2020 Republican National Convention, from Washington on Aug\u00a024, 2020.

Scott highlighted the Trump administration\u2019s work on criminal justice reform, an important accomplishment in the current political environment.In addition to party business and formal nominations, the conventions generally serve as an opportunity for political parties to offer their loyal supporters some love and affirmation and a sense of common purpose.But this year, Democrats and Republicans both believe they need more than party unity \u2013 they need the conventions to prompt greater political participation among their supporters.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Why do female political candidates get such a hard time?READ:\u00a0Commentary: Kamala Harris brings several credentials as potential US vice-presidentWHILE THE DEMOCRATS FRAMED VOTING AS A SACRED DUTYOn the Democratic side, the progressive and moderate wings of the party are united in a way that they weren\u2019t in 2016.The inclusion of respected Republican figures in the convention, such as former Ohio Governor John Kasich, General Colin Powell and Cindy McCain, widow of late Senator John McCain, offered a safe opening for rank-and-file Republicans to cross over and vote for Biden this time.But the logistics of casting a ballot for the Democratic candidate are complicated by the pandemic, long-time voter-suppression tactics focused on communities of colour, and disinformation campaigns (domestic and international).Nearly all the speakers at the Democratic convention worked to persuade people to treat voting like a sacred duty. Former First Lady Michelle Obama explicitly told Democrats to vote in person if they can, because there is a concerted effort underway to keep them from voting.Trump\u2019s campaign faces the same uncertainties as the Democrats as far as voting during a pandemic, and Trump's efforts to undercut the US Post Office and cast doubt on the legality of mail-in voting are likely to hurt Republican and Democratic voters alike.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nVoters in Pennsylvania, like Trump backer Tom Horan, will play an important role in the election AFP/Eric BARADAT\n                            \n\n                    \n                But these efforts have always been more about undermining the legitimacy of the election, which some suspect is Trump\u2019s back-up plan for remaining in power.AN AMBITIOUS GOAL FOR TRUMPIn terms of winning outright, Trump can only work within the confines of the base that he has nurtured, which puts him in a precarious position.A political strategy that rejects unifying themes is not entirely crazy, but it\u2019s definitely risky.The best opportunity for the Trump campaign to pick up support resides with white working-class Americans in battleground states who did not vote last time. This pool of non-voters is significant.However, the last time they contributed meaningfully to a Republican victory was when they came out in 2004 for George W Bush.Karl Rove, the strategist behind Bush\u2019s 2004 victory, suggested that these voters are an opportunity for Trump if he can avoid alienating others and develop a unifying message.\u00a0That goal seems ambitious.Erin Hurley is an expert on the intersection between US national security policy and domestic politics.

Her advantage evaporated in the days that followed with the tallying of postal ballots.\"Electoral corruption - call for a new election?\" President Donald Trump posted on Twitter at the time. His suggestion had no effect, and McSally conceded to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema six days after Election Day.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementA similar \"blue shift,\" with blue representing Democrats, could play out in the Nov 3 US presidential election, with the Republican Trump, 74, ahead in early returns and Democrat Joe Biden, 77, emerging as the winner in the days that follow.READ:\u00a0Biden and Trump go on the offensive as US campaign enters final stretchNearly half of Democrats say they plan to vote by mail, while only one quarter of Republicans plan to do so, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling in August. Demand is driven in no small part by fear of infection from the coronavirus in public.Counting mail ballots is often slower because officials must open thick envelopes, verify the ballots and validate voters' identities, compared with the simpler, speedier process at a polling center where voters cast ballots in person.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementBiden's campaign is bracing for Trump to complain the contest is being stolen as the lead shifts, say people close to the Biden campaign.Even some Republicans worry that Trump might exploit the uncertainty to cast doubt on the results if he ends up losing.\"The longer it takes to count absentee ballots, the more the narrative will take hold among Trump supporters and will be their 'proof' to question unfavorable election results,\" said Dennis Darnoi, a Republican strategist based in Michigan, a state Trump won by less than a percentage point in 2016.Trump repeatedly makes unfounded claims that mail voting leads to fraud, even though multiple studies show voter fraud in the United States to be extremely rare.\n    AdvertisementTrump refuses to say whether he will respect the outcome if he loses. His stance on the matter appears to have undermined Republican voters' confidence.In more than 30 states, including such battleground states as Arizona, Florida and North Carolina that traditionally decide elections, officials can begin processing or even counting ballots before Election Day.But three Rust Belt states considered among the most competitive - Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - prohibit officials from processing, let alone counting, ballots before Election Day.\"If the election comes down to these states, and everyone is waiting on results, I'm concerned about social unrest. This is especially true if Trump is ahead on Election Day,\" said Rick Hasen, an elections expert and law professor at the University of California at Irvine.Trump campaign spokeswoman Thea McDonald said Democrats are creating chaos by \"peddling conspiracy theories.\"\"President Trump and his campaign are fighting for a free, fair, transparent election in which every valid ballot counts \u2014 once,\" she said.DOOMSDAY SCENARIO?A winner might still emerge quickly if such states as Arizona and Florida, which have a long history of mail voting, post results hours after polls close.\"The most likely scenario is that we'll know who the president is on Election Night,\" said Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida. \"I'm not as worried by these doomsday scenarios.\"Florida election officials, for instance, will begin opening and verifying ballots at least three weeks before the election, though they are not able to tally the results to determine which candidate is ahead during that time.Presidential elections are decided by an Electoral College, not the popular vote, meaning results in a battleground state such as Florida, with 29 of the 270 electors needed to win, could decide the outcome once its results are known.In Michigan, a bipartisan effort to process ballots a day before Election Day has failed to gain traction, as some Republicans, without evidence, have argued that it might allow local officials to tamper with the results.Ruth Johnson, the Republican state senator who proposed the bill and who was previously in charge of elections as Michigan's secretary of state, said she did not know why the state's Republican Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey had yet to act.\"It needs to be a priority, and I believe we do have the votes,\" Johnson said.Shirkey did not respond to requests for comment.Asked about pre-Election Day ballot processing, Trump campaign spokeswoman Thea McDonald said the campaign is \"opposed to election officials knowing - and potentially attempting to change - the running tally before Election Day.\"In Pennsylvania, Democrats and Republicans negotiating measures to begin opening mail ballots before Election Day face an uphill fight with the Republican-led legislature asking in return for limits on the number of ballot drop boxes.No such effort is underway in Wisconsin."},

In response, China has unveiled its own proposal for data security standards, based on cyber sovereignty.This would enable individual countries to regulate and control their uses of the internet.The US\u2019s threat-driven narrative of China now goes well beyond Trump\u2019s long-standing obsession with trade imbalances, though these remain a core part of his message.\u00a0READ:\u00a0Commentary: Will China\u2019s new data security initiative define global norms?READ:\u00a0Commentary: Would using TikTok really have national security implications?After protracted negotiations, the two countries signed a phase one trade agreement in January 2020, obligating China to make large-scale purchases of US agricultural products and manufactured goods.Trump saw the agreement as vindicating his belief in managed trade, but \u2014 partly because of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 the accord has done little to narrow the trade imbalance.\u00a0Moreover, his unilateral imposition of new tariffs, initiated in 2018, failed to recognise that China would impose retaliatory tariffs of its own. Trump remains unwilling or unable to grasp that tariffs are a tax on US consumers and US companies, representing a dual liability to the United States.SOBERING OUTLOOKThe investment outlook is even more sobering.

This includes Huawei, a leader in telecommunications gear and already well advanced in its 5G ambitions.The United States is pressuring its closest allies to sever or at least sharply curtail their links with Huawei, which it deems a major national security threat and commercial challenger.New US regulations prohibiting the sale of US chips to Huawei for smartphone manufacturing will deny Huawei the ability to compete once its existing inventory of chips is exhausted.READ:\u00a0Commentary: TikTok and Microsoft and how government agendas are reshaping Big TechREAD:\u00a0Commentary: How Singapore can thrive in a world past peak trade, with more regional blocsBut it provides a powerful impetus for China to devote major resources to the indigenous development of advanced chips.Punitive sanctions are an additional weapon in the administration\u2019s arsenal. These are aimed at senior Chinese officials held responsible for policies that the United States deems objectionable or illegal, at commercial entities accused of technology theft, and at firms with substantial assets in the United States.Such measures are expected to inflict pain on China, though it seems likely to spur Beijing to pursue closer ties with major trade partners other than the United States.It is also unclear how the administration expects these actions to induce longer-term Chinese behaviour that would address US grievances.Trump and his advisers seem to believe that punitive policies will slow China\u2019s advance, and that characterising China as the preeminent threat to the United States will benefit Trump\u2019s re-election prospects.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump takes questions during a news conference in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, U.S., September 16, 2020.

Over the past decade, in response to US diplomatic and economic pressure, its security forces looked to Russia, key economic sectors looked to China, and the Rouhani government reached out to Europe.Now, with Sino-American tensions rising, Iran is looking to China to shore up its economy and balance the US. Closer ties with China would give Iran more leverage in future talks with the US and Europe when it comes to revising or restoring the JCPOA, as well as in its dealings with regional rivals such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.A MINEFIELD FOR CHINABy contrast, a strategic partnership with Iran is a minefield for China. Although China continues to trade with Iran and invest in the country\u2019s infrastructure, a deepening of ties could raise America\u2019s ire at a critical and increasingly sensitive diplomatic juncture.By potentially exposing itself to US sanctions, China risks losing some access to the US market (which is far larger than that of Iran).

So will America\u2019s influenceMore broadly, China has steadily increased its interest in West Asia over the past decade. It is the chief sponsor of the regional Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and it has invested upwards of US$57 billion in Pakistan.With the US set to leave Afghanistan, a partnership with Iran will give China a near-stranglehold over the strategic corridor stretching from Central Asia to the Arabian Sea.As part of this expansion, China could even gain control of the Iranian port of Chahbahar, which its main Asian rival, India, has been developing in response to China\u2019s development of the nearby Pakistani port of Gwador. The Chahbahar port allows India to circumvent Pakistan \u2013 another rival \u2013 in its trade with Central Asia.But, despite the port\u2019s recognised importance, US sanctions are forcing India out of Chahbahar and frustrating Iran.In fact, Iran is already reportedly forcing India out of a railway project that bypasses Pakistan to connect with Afghanistan and Central Asia.

Though the US has long wanted to shift away from the Middle East to focus more on China, the emerging Sino-Iranian deal reminds us that the two theaters are by no means separate.By increasing pressure on both China and Iran, the US has encouraged the two countries to forge a common front. Though the Sino-Iranian a relationship is still a long way from becoming a new axis, the recent negotiations show that such an arrangement is possible.American foreign policymakers should take note. The US will need to try placing a wedge between China and Iran, which requires deciding which one poses the greater threat.Americans may want nothing more than to leave the Middle East once and for all. But the fact is that the strategic competition with China will not play out only in East Asia.Vali Nasr is Professor of Middle East Studies and International Affairs at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s School of Advanced International Studies.

Aides say he wants to focus on his ability to lead the country's economic comeback, his one bright spot in polls.The view inside the White House, however, is that it will be hard for Trump to gain ground until there is more scrutiny of Biden, who has mostly stayed off the campaign trail due to stay-at-home orders during the virus outbreak.\"Until the media starts calling out Joe Biden for just hanging out in his basement, I don\u2019t know how we end this cycle we\u2019re in because we're the only ones out there taking shots,\" said a Republican official familiar with the internal dynamics at the White House.Biden has said he would prefer in-person campaigning but that relying on virtual events has allowed him to reach more people directly than he would have otherwise.A DIVISIVE MESSAGEDuring a presidency rife with controversy, Trump often has mastered changing the subject - but less so with the spotlight on a months-long pandemic that has killed more than 127,000 Americans and put millions of Americans out of work.He has further divided the country with a \"law-and-order\" message that critics say fails to address the twin issues of police brutality and racial inequality at the heart of nationwide street protests.At campaign events on Tuesday, Biden said the president was pitting Americans against one another instead of leading.\"They're looking at this appeal to hate and how it's divided the country. And they're tired of it,\" Biden said of the public's changing mood.Some supporters were disappointed last week when Trump did not directly respond when asked by Fox News Channel anchor Sean Hannity, a close friend, to share plans for his second term.Trump has outlined his plans in broad strokes that include rebuilding the economy and taking on China, but he has yet to specify what he would do with another four years.\"He needs to articulate why he wants a second term,\" said the Republican official familiar with internal White House dynamics.In a memo on Sunday, deputy campaign manager Bill Stepien battled the poor poll numbers by arguing that Trump leads Biden in voter enthusiasm and remains strong in key states according to internal campaign data.\"We know the media loves to play the game of using their public polling to create an unfavorable scenario and to attempt to discourage President Trump\u2019s supporters,\" Stepien said. \"As we can see from the obvious level of enthusiasm among Republicans, especially as compared to Joe Biden\u2019s situation, it is not working.\"The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted this week online, gave Biden an advantage of 8 percentage points over Trump in support among registered voters. Biden had a 10-point edge in a similar poll last week.With his signature, large-scale rallies sidelined by fears of COVID-19 infections, Trump has been considering doing media interviews beyond conservative Fox News, his usual venue, one ally said.There have been some discussions of increasing the role of senior adviser Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, who is already heavily involved in the campaign, two officials said.On Wednesday, a source confirmed that Michael Glassner, who organized Trump's rallies, had been \"reassigned\" as a legal adviser for the campaign following the disappointing rally last month in Tulsa.Trump's 2016 Arizona chairman, Jeff DeWit, will join the campaign as chief operating officer to oversee the final stretch to Election Day, the source said."},

It is a measure of Mr Sanders\u2019 influence that few doubt his likely pick will be female, non-white and from the left of the Democratic party. A centrist is highly unlikely.Names such as Stacey Abrams, the former gubernatorial candidate in Georgia, and Val Demings, the congresswoman from Florida, have been aired. Kamala Harris, the former presidential candidate has also been touted, although the US senator\u2019s centrist tilt on economics may prove a weakness.READ: Commentary: As the US plays the blame game, China steps up its global leadershipREAD: Commentary: China billionaires a force to be reckoned with in global COVID-19 fight - and moreMs Abrams, in particular, could strike a chord given the Democratic focus on protecting the voter franchise.Mr Trump has made it clear he opposes attempts to make mail-in balloting easier.

But the local Chinese Communist Party secretary blocked the deal.\n    AdvertisementDespite being less competitive, over time some Chinese companies grew huge because they had largely exclusive access to the biggest and fastest growing market, China, as well as Western markets.For example, the Chinese food processing company WH Group grew so big that it was able to buy US meat processing company Smithfield Foods. It is now the biggest force in the US market, towering over Hormel Foods.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFILE PHOTO: A truck arrives at Smithfield Foods' pork plant in Smithfield, Virginia, U.S. October 17, 2019.

Major US and EU businesses therefore support a decisive challenge to China\u2019s misbehaviour.PURSUING MARKET RECIPROCITYThe right strategy to counter this is to restrict or deny market access to Chinese companies in sectors where China formally or informally restricts foreign companies\u2019 access. And Western governments should help domestic companies develop technology superior to Huawei\u2019s.They should make it clear that Huawei \u2013 and other Chinese companies \u2013 will get access when Chinese policy offers commensurate market access and meets their security concerns. Denying Huawei market access now is appropriate, but the door must be open for a future solution.READ: Commentary: Why are Chinese officials acting like Internet trolls and entertaining online fights with the US?Since Huawei\u2019s major foreign competitors are European, this is the perfect opportunity to build US-EU cooperation.The US and EU are wide open in the sectors where China has a comparative advantage, namely manufacturing, while China remains largely closed in the sectors where the West has a comparative advantage, mainly services.So in addition to restricting China\u2019s access in services, Western countries need targeted restrictions in manufacturing too.READ: Commentary: Why the UK had to say yes to HuaweiSimilar market reciprocity issues existed between the US and Japan when the latter became a major global economy.

He deliberately creates a cold war atmosphere designed to mobilise his domestic voter base rather than to solve international problems.He has convinced China\u2019s leaders that his goal is to bring China down.In so doing, he alienates much of the US and EU business community, who want the problems solved, not rendered impossible. Unsurprisingly, China responds with threats to cripple or kill US companies like Boeing.When Xi came to power, Chinese and foreign elites expected, based on the book China 2030 and other extensive planning efforts, that China was about to move decisively ahead to liberalise its obsolete infant industry protectionism.Instead, Xi has moved backward, with more policies to secure a protected China market for domestic companies and consolidate champions designed to dominate global markets.READ: Commentary: China\u2019s removal of GDP targets reveals its new economic strategyREAD: Commentary: This time China has no choice but to push economic reformsTrump\u2019s reaction typifies his larger China strategy. The US has major issues with China about market access, intellectual property theft and security.But Trump has focused more attention on phony issues, for instance, targeting China on currency manipulation. There was a time when China\u2019s undervalued currency gave their exports an unfair advantage, but for years now China\u2019s currency has been overvalued and Trump\u2019s response is to lie about it.Trump\u2019s lead issue has been the trade balance. But any economics student knows that the US trade balance is determined by the domestic gap between what the country saves and what it spends. Trump\u2019s enormous budget deficits have made both that gap, and the US trade deficit, huge.Trump\u2019s approach maximises the conflicts that mobilise his voter base and deflects attention from his domestic failures.

Chinese culture and history offer a better way to understand the three messages China intends to convey to salvage relations with the United States.CHINA DOES NOT WANT CONFLICTFirst, China does not want a Cold War with the United States. Wang Yi remarked that China was not the former Soviet Union and it had no intention of becoming another United States.This might be wishful thinking from the CCP, but it takes two to tango, and China has said it wants to avoid the Cold War trap that ensnared the Soviet Union and the United States.Wang and Yang highlighted the good old days of US\u2013China relations after Richard Nixon\u2019s 1972 visit to remind their US counterparts that the two countries co-existed by transcending their ideological differences.

China wants to make it clear to US allies \u2014 including five-eyes countries Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Canada \u2014 that it has no intention to fight a new Cold War with the United States.By striking a conciliatory tone, China aims to reduce the likelihood of the United States building a coalition against it. China\u2019s anti-Cold War effort can also be seen in Wang Yi\u2019s recent visits to five European countries.Other interested countries \u2014 especially US allies \u2014 will need to choose whether to turn the Cold War into a reality or treat it as an illusion of the four horsemen.While the Trump administration is trying to checkmate China through short-term confrontation, Chinese leaders are playing a game of Go insofar as they are seeking to position themselves for future advantages. This avoids direct confrontation in a game of high stakes, even if it forsakes short-term gains.THE DANGERS OF CONFLICTThe third and final message is a warning to the international community about the danger of a potential conflict between the United States and China.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nBeijing claims historical rights to vast swathes of the South China Sea, including islands, reefs and atolls in the Spratlys.

I realised this during the nearly three months I spent in Mumbai during the lockdown, when family and friends told me of conflicts, showdowns and frayed nerves in the city.Whereas some residents were castigated for not wearing face masks or for violating social-distancing norms, others were criticised for overdoing the lockdown.\n    Advertisement\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nPeople wait in a queue to board a public bus after some restrictions were lifted during a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Mumbai, India, June 8, 2020.

Certain social and institutional pre-conditions must be present for an economy to function effectively.But the economics profession widely overlooked these important reminders, or, at best, put them aside with a nod.In my book Beyond the Invisible Hand, I argued that trade and exchange depend not only on technical assumptions of which all economists are aware, such as the law of diminishing marginal utility, but also on other conditions that we take for granted.These include being able to trust one another and our ability to communicate, which allows us to negotiate and conclude deals. But no economist writes down \u201ccan talk\u201d as an assumption. It is regarded as a given.\u00a0IS THE HAND INVISIBLE?Unfortunately, this approach has led to big gaps in our understanding of how the invisible hand works.Many conservative economists stress that as long as governments do not intervene and curb individual freedoms, economies will function efficiently. The invisible hand will do it all.\u00a0READ:\u00a0Commentary: COVID-19 will bring on the Great Reset the world needsBut they forget that efficiency also requires many curbs on how we behave, such as not punching other traders in the face and running away with their goods.This oversight has in turn led to major policy-making mistakes, such as the \u201cWashington Consensus,\u201d which advocated curbing government intervention in the economy and tightly controlling fiscal deficits.As Joseph Stiglitz has pointed out, this so-called Washington Consensus was in fact confined to the area between Washington\u2019s 15th and 19th Streets, where the US Department of the Treasury, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are housed.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFILE PHOTO: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters building is seen ahead of the IMF/World Bank spring meetings in Washington, U.S., April 8, 2019. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo\n                            \n\n                    \n                Nonetheless, this new orthodoxy was then thrust upon all developing economies, regardless of whether they met the social and institutional conditions these policies require. Not surprisingly, the measures often backfired.Fortunately, there is now a growing recognition that price adjustments are not the sole or even the necessary factors that help markets to clear.In a recent paper, Michael Richter and Ariel Rubinstein show that markets can clear in different ways, some of which rely entirely on social norms.\u00a0IDENTIFYING RELEVANT NORMSIn most households, even large ones, the refrigerator is left open and its contents do not have prices marked. But the refrigerator does not get drained within moments of being stocked.\u00a0Many kinds of behaviour are socially forbidden, and in some societies these prohibitions have become so deeply embedded psychologically that no outside authority is needed to enforce them.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Everything a post-lockdown new normal needs we haven't thought about enoughThis opens up a potentially large research agenda regarding the norms we should encourage to make economies more equitable and productive.The COVID-19 pandemic, by making the tacit overt, has raised awareness of this challenge \u2013 and interesting findings are beginning to appear.In a recent paper, for example, Wooyoung Lim and Pengfei Zhang use laboratory experiments to show how pro-vaccination behavioural norms can arise voluntarily, potentially helping populations to achieve herd immunity.But not all good norms arise voluntarily; nor do societies have to wait for the slow process of evolution to unfold before converging on them. Instead, contemporary research should enable us to isolate desirable norms that we can then consciously try to nurture.For example, we have now learned that during pandemics, we should stay two meters from others and wear face masks.This did not happen voluntarily, or because those who did not follow these norms died, but because research by epidemiologists taught us these norms, and governments enforced or encouraged adherence to them.One hopes that the disruption caused by COVID-19 will likewise spur economists to identify norms that can help us build a more equitable, prosperous, and sustainable world.BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the novel coronavirus and its developmentsDownload\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegram\u00a0Kaushik Basu, a former chief economist of the World Bank and chief economic adviser to the Government of India, is Professor of Economics at Cornell University and Non-resident Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution."},

These five states are worth 90 Electoral College votes.Biden also leads the polls in consistently Republican-voting Arizona (11 electoral votes).So, if we take recent polls in these states at face value, then Trump would lose 101 of the Electoral College votes he won in 2016 and be soundly defeated.READ: Commentary: The hope for change in a Biden-Harris US election winCAN STATE POLLS BE TRUSTED?But state polls were heavily criticised in 2016 for underestimating Trump\u2019s support.The final poll averages in 2016 underestimated Trump\u2019s margin over Clinton by more than five points in several swing states: North Carolina (5.3), Iowa (5.7), Minnesota (5.7), Ohio (6.9) and Wisconsin (7.2).

The number of \u201cundecideds\u201d in 2016 was more than double that in prior elections. Of these, a disproportionate number voted for Trump.But 2020 polling to date reveals far fewer undecided voters, suggesting this source of poll error will not be as large in this year\u2019s election.READ: Commentary: A softer Donald Trump could win the US electionREAD: Commentary: This may be the most important US election everSecond, there were changes in voter turnout. In 2016, Trump successfully mobilised white voters who are becoming a smaller portion of the American electorate and ordinarily have low rates of voter turnout. These were largely non-urban voters and those with lower levels of education.This year will likely see high levels of engagement from both sides \u2013 and potentially a surge in turnout unseen in decades \u2013 which could further undermine the accuracy of election polls.REINTERPRETING THE 2020 POLLSThe latest state poll averages imply Biden will handily win the election with an Electoral College victory of 334 to 204.But if the 2020 polls are as wrong as they were in 2016, then Biden\u2019s current poll leads in New Hampshire, North Carolina and Wisconsin are misleading. If Biden loses these three states, the Electoral College result will be 305-233, still a comfortable Biden win.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n(Graphic: United States Studies Centre, University of Sydney)\n\n                            \n\n                    \n                In recent weeks, however, we have seen Biden\u2019s poll leads in Pennsylvania and Florida be smaller than the corresponding poll error in those states from 2016.If Trump wins these two large states (in addition to New Hampshire, North Carolina and Wisconsin), and the other 2016 results are replicated elsewhere, then he will narrowly win the election with 282 Electoral College votes.Given the statistical range of poll errors seen in 2016 \u2013 and assuming they reoccur in 2020 \u2013 current polling implies Trump has roughly a one in three chance of winning re-election.READ: Commentary: A better version of America is emergingOTHER FACTORS IN PLAYThe COVID-19 pandemic and controversies around the administration of the election could further jeopardise the validity of 2020 polling. Official statistics already show many voters are attempting to make use of voting by mail or in-person, early voting.Access to these alternative forms of voting varies tremendously across the United States, so the political consequences are difficult to anticipate.Trump and his Republican supporters have raised doubts about the validity and security of vote by mail. A recent opinion poll showed Democrats are much more likely to rely on vote by mail compared to Republicans (72 per cent to 22 per cent).Unsurprisingly, Democrats and other groups are bringing numerous lawsuits to help ensure vote by mail remains a widely available method of voting.It is quite likely the courts will be asked to rule on the validity of the results after the election, on the basis mail ballots have been either improperly included or excluded in official tallies.READ: US vote-by-mail begins as White House campaign gets ugly\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFILE PHOTO: Workers empty a carton of ballots from a drop box to prepare them for the mail sorting machine during the presidential primary at King County Elections ballot processing center in Renton, Washington, U.S. March 10, 2020.

But offsetting this is tremendous uncertainty about turnout and whose votes will be cast and counted.All this suggests considerable caution be exercised in relying on the polls to forecast the election. These forecasts are almost surely overconfident.The other main takeaway: Trump\u2019s chances of re-election are likely higher than suggested by the polling we have seen to date.Simon Jackman is CEO of the US Studies Centre, University of Sydney.

For many, that order has been synonymous with US geopolitical dominance.But in the absence of US leadership, competing political models are coming to the fore, promoting nationalism, populism, and various stripes of \u201cilliberal democracy.\u201dAmerica\u2019s split personality will affect more than just Americans.Barring a return to form in Washington\u00a0DC, the prognosis for the dollar-centric post-war order looks grim.Benjamin J Cohen, Professor of International Political Economy at the University of California, Santa Barbara, is the author, most recently, of Currency Statecraft: Monetary Rivalry and Geopolitical Ambition."},

Chinese state-owned trading company Zhuhai Zhenrong had previously also been sanctioned for a similar reason.There were also reports of Indian purchases of Iranian oil.Asian nations such as these need to ensure their oil-purchasing contracts don\u2019t violate international sanctions by importing Iranian crude.\u00a0Any continued indifference by these\u00a0Asian countries to the source of their oil otherwise risks carving out a new reality in the Middle East \u2013 Iran\u2019s growing control over Iraq.Given Asia is Iraq\u2019s largest export destination, if countries in the region continue their unchecked purchasing of Iranian oil through Iraqi supplies, then Iran will only feel more empowered and vindicated to stay in Iraq as it eyes a secure source of revenue.US SANCTIONSWashington had imposed the sanctions to curtail Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and regional expansion \u2013 especially in Iraq \u2013 and is going after anyone who buys Iranian crude.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nIran is among the world's top oil producers, but has struggled to sell its crude under US sanctions AFP/STR\n                            \n\n                    \n                The sanctions have idled at least a quarter of Iranian oilrigs and drastically cut oil exports by over 50 per cent with the US even targeting Iran\u2019s floating oil storage.Washington has warned shippers, insurers and port authorities that storing Iranian crude will bring the wrath of US sanctions.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Hin Leong's financial woes suggest oil traders haven't learnt their lessonsYet Iran continues to export oil, using all the back channels it can think of. Plenty of trading companies handle oil, and some of these try to disguise its origin.US administration officials have told media that Iranian and Chinese tankers avoid scrutiny by transferring oil to other ships, turning off their radio identification equipment or changing their names, for example, and that they are maintaining close surveillance on such activity.Last year, for instance, ship tracking data from financial information provider Refinitiv Eikon showed that 14 vessels belonging to Chinese shipping company COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) stopped sending location data from their automatic identification system (AIS) between Sep 30 and Oct 7.US officials confirmed that its findings show that COSCO had been shutting off AIS on its ships. \u00a0HOW MIGHT TEHRAN REACT?As prices continue to slide, oil-heavy and cash-hungry economies like Iran will become even more aggressive about selling large quantities of crude.However, Iran\u2019s sanctions, its control of Iraq, and the proximity of its oil fields to the Iraqi terminals means Tehran is more likely to engage in supply-chain subversion.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFILE PHOTO: A general view of Abadan oil refinery in southwest Iran, is pictured from Iraqi side of Shatt al-Arab in Al-Faw south of Basra, Iraq September 21, 2019.

According to Lynch, it is estimated that Iran is still exporting 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil.\u00a0While this is lower than the 2.5 million bpd per day Iran was exporting before the most recent sanctions and amounts to only about a supertanker a week, it is still hard to disguise the export of this much oil unless it is smuggled out of Iran.Nevertheless, without a naval cordon, it would be nearly impossible to stop all Iranian oil exports \u2013 especially as both Tehran and its customers are busily working out ways to evade financial oversight and circumvent the sanctions.Although the US could try to seize tankers leaving Iraq and test the chemistry of the oil to determine its origin, such a step probably isn\u2019t legal or feasible.That\u2019s why it\u2019s vital for Asian buyers to ensure that their trade policies are mindful of the realities of the Middle East, even as they grapple with the economic and medical crisis triggered by COVID-19.Asia\u2019s large oil buyers now have an opportunity to support Iraq become a more independent nation, and secure their own oil contracts in the process.As the Iraqi people protest against Iranian interference, and their own government\u2019s complicity, a broad range of pro-sovereignty and anti-Iran movements are beginning to gather steam in the country.Falling under the management of the Sovereignty Alliance for Iraq (SAI), groups like the National Wisdom Council and the National Independent Iraqi Front are considered viable options to create an anti-sectarian and unified Iraq that could reassert Iraqi sovereignty over its own oil.If Iraq can weather the current oil supply glut, then these movements will be crucial to help revive its oil industry once prices pick-up.For Asia, these groups offer political and trade certainty \u2013 a unified and sovereign Iraqi oil industry would not conflict with prevailing Iranian sanctions and can be a reliable source for its oil demand.Given it is a buyers\u2019 market, Asian buyers can seize the moment to develop oil contracts that are cognizant of the realities in the Middle East and give the Iraqi industry a much-needed boost.Mohammed Abdul Shihab is Managing Director of Al-Sharq Advisory."},

Retaining sanctions that cripple health-care systems, such as in Iran (the third-most-affected country), is not only morally reprehensible; it undermines America\u2019s own interests, both by enabling the virus to continue to spread and by reinforcing the image of the US as a villain.Meanwhile, China \u2013 along with Russia \u2013 has urged the US to change its approach.But the US is not only indifferent to the suffering of its adversaries; it also has little concern for its allies.

Thanks to Trump, the US will almost certainly lose the great-power competition \u2013 and countless lives.BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the novel coronavirus\u00a0and its developmentsDownload our app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramVali Nasr is Professor of Middle East Studies and International Affairs at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s School of Advanced International Studies."},

So far, more than 160 candidate vaccines are in development.Some 31 of these have entered human clinical trials. One of them is Russia\u2019s Sputnik V, which was granted approval by the country\u2019s health ministry last week.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementBut the World Health Organisation (WHO) and a large number of international experts have urged Russia to conduct more testing to ensure the vaccine\u2019s safety before using it.Even if this candidate and others are proven to be safe and effective, developing the vaccine is just the first step. Some of the biggest challenges in getting everyone vaccinated still lie ahead.LISTEN: The COVID-19 vaccine will be the biggest product launch in history. Can we pull it off?READ: Commentary: COVID-19 vaccine \u2013 why is it taking so long to develop one?\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementMANUFACTURING THE VACCINE The first major challenge after a vaccine is developed is to produce enough of it to start vaccination programmes. One estimate puts global vaccine production capacity at up to 6.4 billion doses per year, though this is based on single-dose influenza vaccines.But some of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in development require two or three injections. This means, if the same technology for COVID-19 vaccines is required as for influenza vaccines, global production is severely reduced.It has been estimated that to achieve sufficient levels of immunity among the global population with a two-dose vaccine, we would need between 12 billion and 15 billion doses \u2013 roughly twice the world\u2019s current total vaccine manufacturing capacity.\n    AdvertisementShifting to exclusively manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine will also mean shortages of other vaccines such as those for preventable childhood diseases such as measles, mumps and rubella. So prioritising COVID-19 could cost many other lives.READ: Commentary: Booster shots will likely be needed even if a COVID-19 vaccine is readyBUYING VACCINES IN ADVANCEGiven these production constraints, governments have previously tended to sign advance purchase agreements with vaccine manufacturers to guarantee access. These commercial-in-confidence agreements are usually signed in secret, often with different prices being charged to different governments depending on whether they are the first customer or 30th and their ability to pay.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFile photo of an employee of German biopharmaceutical company CureVac, demonstrating research on a vaccine for COVID-19\u00a0at a laboratory in Tuebingen, Germany, Mar\u00a012, 2020.

This has happened on at least two previous occasions.In 2007, Indonesia found it couldn\u2019t purchase H5N1 influenza (bird flu) vaccines despite being one of the worst-affected countries at the time. This was because several other richer countries had already organised advanced purchase agreements, and led Indonesia to temporarily withhold sharing virus samples with the WHO in retaliationAnd in 2009, rich nations bought up almost all the stock of H1N1 influenza vaccines, crowding out less-developed nations.LISTEN:\u00a0Recovery, restructuring and possibly rebound? The outlook for the Singapore economyREAD: Commentary: As world waits for coronavirus vaccine, antibodies treatment a needed plan BMost of the world\u2019s leaders have stated that a successful COVID-19 vaccine should be shared equitably. The COVAX\u00a0initiative launched by the WHO, global vaccine alliance GAVI, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, aims to deliver 2 billion doses of a COVID-19 vaccine by the end of 2021.Countries representing 60 per cent of the world\u2019s population have signed up to this initiative, but not everyone has and we\u2019ve already seen a number of instances in which governments have sought to gain priority access over others.The problem with this vaccine nationalism is that rather than being based on equity or need, it will create global supply problems with those countries that have special deals getting access to the vaccine first.READ: WHO calls for end to COVID-19 'vaccine nationalism'DISTRIBUTING THE VACCINEThe second key challenge is distributing the COVID-19 vaccine. Most vaccines need to be transported in cold storage, which presents a problem for many parts of the world where electricity failure is a common feature of daily life.The WHO has estimated up to 50 per cent of vaccines are wasted every year, often because of inadequate temperature control in supply chains.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nA health worker shows unused packs of anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia before returning it inside a freezer for storage at the Manila Health Department, Dec\u00a05, 2017. (Photo: Reuters/Romeo Ranoco)\n                            \n\n                    \n                With the marked reduction in international passenger air travel, the movement of cargo has also slowed. This will need to be addressed with airlines ahead of any attempts to distribute the vaccine.Beyond the initial transport from the manufacturer, getting the vaccine to rural and remote communities requires sophisticated logistical services, which many poorer countries lack.Without substantial investment to strengthen international and national supply chains, it will be years before vaccines can reach everyone who needs them.READ: When can you get a COVID-19 vaccine? Five things you should knowREAD: Commentary: How \u2018good\u2019 does a COVID-19 vaccine need to be to stop the pandemic?While some might argue more needs to be done to secure a COVID-19 vaccine, it\u2019s not necessarily the best move to enter into advanced purchase agreements. They are expensive, and there\u2019s no guarantee the candidates will be safe and effective.Nevertheless,\u00a0avoiding\u00a0putting all eggs in one basket and\u00a0supporting multiple vaccine initiatives is sensible strategy.\u00a0It\u2019s also good to see\u00a0governments supporting\u00a0initiatives such as COVAX that aim to make the vaccine available to those countries with limited means to pay. While some may see this as excessive altruism, it\u2019s in the broader interest, given borders are likely to remain closed until a vaccine has been made widely available. The quicker the world is vaccinated, the sooner borders can be reopened.What this means for the average person is that we should get ready for a long wait. Even with an advanced purchase agreement to secure priority access to a safe and effective COVID vaccine, initial supplies are going to be extremely limited.Priority groups like frontline healthcare workers will get first access, followed by those who are more vulnerable to serious illness. If you\u2019re otherwise fit and healthy, you should be prepared that it could take up to a few years after vaccines become available.If they become available sooner, it will only be because countries have agreed to work together like never before. Let\u2019s hope they can do it.BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the\u00a0coronavirus outbreak and its developmentsDownload our app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the COVID-19 outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramAdam Kamradt-Scott is Associate Professor at the Centre for International Security Studies, University of Sydney.

This was an overdue correction in response to a more ideological, authoritarian and assertive China.Yet the \u201cAmerica First\u201d narrative, devaluing of allies, and coercive trade policies undercut US strategic objectives, alienating friends and feeding doubt about the durability of America\u2019s commitment to the Indo-Pacific.READ:\u00a0Commentary: COVID-19 emphasises the importance of Singapore\u2019s free trade agreementsIt is often argued that an \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to the world is the inevitable consequence of the weariness of the American public with costly foreign wars and the job losses and cultural \u201chomogenisation\u201d that have come with globalisation.There is some truth to this.

behind iron ore, coal and natural gas - with more than 500,000 international students enrolled last year, bringing about A$37 billion into the economy.Australia's trade minister said on Wednesday that the Australian economy, facing its first recession in 30 years because of the coronavirus, would suffer if Chinese students heeded the warning to stay away.\"We would feel the effect - our universities would, if we saw a downturn in international student numbers,\" trade minister Simon Birmingham told media.Birmingham said it would also be a loss for Chinese students and in the long term \"would do nothing to help further the mutual understanding between our two nations\".On Tuesday, Birmingham said Australia had \"zero tolerance\" towards racism and had established processes to stamp it out.China's statement came a day after a foreign ministry spokesperson warned of \"a lot of discrimination\" against Chinese people in Australia - and days after Beijing told citizens not to travel there at all.As China has pursued a more combative foreign policy and sought to assert itself on the world stage, tensions with many democracies have risen.In response to Australia backing the call for an independent virus inquiry, China's ambassador in Canberra threatened a widespread consumer boycott of Australian products - a warning followed up by a bar on four major Australian beef exporters.That was followed in May by an 80 per cent tariff on Australian barley over dumping allegations, a move grain growers say will cost at least A$500 million (US$350 million) a year."},

It shows that the COVAX facility is open for business and is attracting the type of interest across the world we had hoped it would,\" he said.COVAX coordinators are in talks with China about whether it might also join, Berkley said.\"We had a discussion yesterday with the (Chinese) government,\" Berkley said. \"We don't have any signed agreement with them yet,\" but Beijing has given \"a positive signal,\" he added.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementCOVAX is co-led by GAVI, the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and is designed to discourage national governments from hoarding COVID-19 vaccines and to focus on first vaccinating the most high-risk people in every country.Its backers say this strategy should lead to lower vaccine costs for everyone and a swifter end to the pandemic that has claimed some 860,000 lives globally.Wealthy countries that join COVAX will finance the vaccine purchases from their national budgets, and will partner with 92 poorer nations supported through voluntary donations to the plan to ensure vaccines are delivered equitably, Berkley said.Participating wealthy countries are also free to procure vaccines through bilateral deals and other plans.\n    AdvertisementREAD:\u00a0Poor countries desperate for COVID-19 vaccines may be outbid by richer neighboursThe United States said on Tuesday it would not join COVAX due to the Trump administration's objection to WHO involvement, a move described by some critics as \"disappointing\". Berkley said he was not surprised by the US\u00a0decision, but would seek to continue talks with Washington.In what appeared to be a change of position on Wednesday, the European Union said its member states could buy potential COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX.COVAX coordinators sought to add flexibility to joining agreements to encourage greater participation, Berkley said.The WHO describes COVAX as an \"invaluable insurance policy\" for all countries to secure access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines when they are developed and approved. The plan's coordinators have set a deadline of Sep\u00a018 for countries signing up to make binding commitments.COVAX's aim is to procure and deliver 2 billion doses of approved vaccines by the end of 2021. It currently has nine COVID-19 vaccine candidates in its portfolio employing a range of different technologies and scientific approaches.A handful are already in late-stage clinical trials and could have data available by year end.BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the\u00a0coronavirus outbreak and its developmentsDownload our app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the COVID-19 outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"},

K-pop fandoms are made up of highly globalised and diversified communities online \u2013 from different races, ethnicities, ages and countries.\n    AdvertisementThe identification of shared experiences builds connections between disparate people, uniting loose networks into tight communities.A generation of fans skilled in online mobilisation, with organisational skills and a keen understanding of social media, has enabled new and ongoing efforts to showcase and boost the support of the fandom\u2019s artistes.This collaborative effort promotes hashtags and topics relating to the performer or fandom to trend, and also fosters a strong sense of social connectivity.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nFans show their support for K-pop act BTS.

Online mobilisation via crowdfunding includes donating to charities and volunteering in emergency situations.Supporting charitable causes is viewed as giving back to the community and the wider society. Fans are also motivated by the desire to make their favourite artists proud of their efforts.Global stans of K-pop band BTS, known as ARMY (Adorable Representative MC for Youth), have supported more than 630 charity projects.

Content spamming and trolling with fancams (short video clips of an artist dancing or singing) was predominantly used.Fancams \u2013 traditionally shared by K-pop stans in response to unrelated social media posts to promote their favourite artists \u2013 were used against digital efforts by the police. The Dallas police department\u2019s iWatch app, for instance, reportedly crashed when K-pop stans overwhelmed the app with fancams.Right-wing hashtags (e.g #whiteoutwednesday, #MAGA) were subjected to hijacking. Fancams and memes were tagged with popular right-wing hashtags, and were used to take over and drown out right-wing narratives.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA man holds a picture of George Floyd during a Black Lives Matter protest in New York City AFP/Jeenah Moon\n                            \n\n                    \n                The use of #BlackLivesMatter further enabled the formation of signposts in which conversations centred around the protests could be galvanised by the international fan community.Hashtags promoted by police departments as tip lines for information were also taken over, causing them to trend under Twitter\u2019s K-pop label.Stans also amplified resources shared by Black Lives Matter activists online. K-pop fan groups and accounts with huge followings (e.g. BTS, Blackpink) promoted helplines and resources. BTS stans rallied under the #MatchAMillion hashtag to raise more than US$1 million in 25 hours to match BTS\u2019 seven-figure contribution for the Black Lives Matter movement.READ: Commentary: Why George Floyd's death could tilt the US election - in Trump's favourREAD: Commentary: George Floyd's death and the rising spectre of a race-based US electionTHE DARK SIDE OF ONLINE ACTIVISMWhile this has demonstrated the agility and effectiveness of social media and its galvanisation towards social activism causes, it raises questions around online mobilisation.One issue that could arise is concern about efforts by state or non-state actors to exploit a situation by using sock-puppet or bot-like accounts. These accounts could be used to disrupt, wrest back or counter trending narratives online.Though there is no evidence that bots or sock-puppet accounts participated in #whiteoutwednesday or other affiliated hashtags, the exploitation and utilisation of such influence tactics could potentially be abused and exploited.This approach is not novel. The US Senate Intelligence Committee report in 2018 detailed Russian efforts to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election. It highlighted that the Internet Research Agency (IRA) utilised social-media influence campaigns to exploit and amplify existing racism and racial conflict in the United States.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nRussia's notorious troll farm the Internet Research Agency manipulated social media to discourage African Americans from voting in the 2016 US presidential election.

Accounts of doxxing and spamming efforts on Twitter have occurred, and could potentially lead to a tit-for-tat retaliatory response online.While stan Twitter has demonstrated its effectiveness in amplifying and mainstreaming important social issues online, the question of the sustainability of such campaigns in the long run remains. A quick shift in public opinion resulting from successful campaigns runs the risk of dissipating over time.If anything, the digital disruption displayed by K-pop stans reflect a growing urgency for new forms of social action.Dymples Leong is a Senior Analyst with Centre of Excellence for National Security (CENS) at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), Nanyang Technological University.

It\u2019s you, the essential workers,\" Biden said during the virtual event with Trumka.Trump said that if Biden were elected, the Democrat would mandate another economic shutdown to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.\"Biden's plan for the China virus is to shut down the entire US\u00a0economy,\" Trump said. \"He'd be laying off tens of millions of workers and causing countless deaths from suicide, substance abuse, depression, heart disease and other very serious illnesses.\"Trump plans to visit North Carolina, Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania later in the week, all considered crucial to both candidates' chances of victory.Polls in Pennsylvania, which Trump won narrowly in 2016, have consistently put Biden in the lead, but averages show that margin narrowing to roughly 4 to 5 percentage points, down from about 8 points in late June.

All of his actions have been supported.He invoked the Defense Production Act to order GM to speed up production of ventilators in one of its auto plants.The Pentagon dispatched its two Navy hospital ships, one each in New York and Los Angeles, and deployed Army hospital units to other locations.Trump also ordered some former service members to return to active duty to assist in the coronavirus response.READ: Commentary: How to tell your stubborn, older relative to adopt social distancingREAD:\u00a0Commentary: Restrictions on movements in some Southeast Asian countries to fight COVID-19 have been patchy, even scaryBut there are limits to the president\u2019s authority.Members of Congress plus state and local officials have autonomous powers needed to win this war.For the president to lead them, they have to want to follow him.DEMOCRATS NOT WELCOME IN THE OVAL OFFICE Only Congress can provide funding for this war effort.Without their appropriation, the President has no money to spend.The Democratic-led House of Representatives and the Republican-controlled Senate worked together to pass the US$2 trillion coronavirus relief bill, believed to be the largest in US history.For every glimmer of hope like the recently passed aid package, there are conflicting signals bipartisanship will not be celebrated such as when President Trump signed the bill into law, he did not invite a single Democrat for the Oval Office ceremony while hosting multiple Republicans.Celebrating only with members of his own party highlights he does not fully grasp the importance of his leading all of the country.More importantly, President Trump also set up a potential battle with Democrats over his desire to exercise unilateral authority over key oversight provisions in the law.Moreover, this stimulus will not be enough. He needs to work with Congress on the next one to win this war, and possibly another after.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Will COVID-19 bring on the next Great Depression?READ: Commentary: The great coronavirus pandemic will lead to another - of unemploymentAfter Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi declared that, \u201cthe president\u2019s denial at the beginning was deadly,\u201d the President described her as \u201ca sick puppy\u201d.Washington needs to be #DCUnited on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.GOVERNORS ARE THEIR OWN GENERALSThe president serves as the nation\u2019s Commander-in-Chief.But what happens when the enemy is a virus within the country and the army fighting the battle is not the US military?Those leading today\u2019s war are the governors of each state. And these \u201cgenerals\u201d do not report to the president.Before Trump announced the extension of the social distancing guidelines to Apr 30, Maryland's Republican Governor Larry Hogan said he was prepared to ignore President Trump if he reverted to his \"very harmful\" message of reopening large sections of the economy by Easter.The president and the governors need to work together. They need to be consulted before actions are contemplated or mused about to the public.Yet, President Trump proclaims he will not work with those he deems unworthy.For example, he accused Democratic governor of Washington State, Jay Inslee, of not being \u201cappreciative\u201d of his coronavirus efforts and said he had directed Vice-President Mike Pence not to call him.\u00a0He did the same with regard to Michigan Governor\u00a0Gretchen Whitmer, also a Democrat when he said: \u201cDon\u2019t call the woman in Michigan.\u201dTHE COUNTRY WANTS TO BE UNITEDAmericans unite behind presidents when victory is a national imperative.The war against the coronavirus must be won. And it will. But when? And at what cost?President Trump discussed how certain parts of the country could re-open for business by Easter.That leads to questions about the president\u2019s total commitment to the cause.\u00a0He also continues to favour his party.Elements of his language seemed to change at his press briefing on Sunday (Mar 29).In announcing his extension of the social distancing measures to Apr 30, he said: \u201cNothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won.\u201dWill that approach remain? Will his rhetoric follow?Imagine if President Trump acts upon the mission set forth for his country by Prime Minister Lee: \u201cWe do not leave anyone behind.\u201d\u201cLeave no one behind.\u201d A universal tradition.

They will have to cut corners and neglect some cases by judicial triage.READ:\u00a0Commentary: It is time central banks and governments shoot for negative interest ratesREAD:\u00a0Commentary: Cash assistance is often shunned but enhances the safety net for low-income familiesGovernment support under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act will prevent some immediate bankruptcies.But many businesses still will struggle to meet their obligations to creditors, employees, and suppliers. And then, like Neiman Marcus, J.C. Penney, and much of the oil industry, they still will be unable to pay their debt.Bankruptcies surged during the 2008 to 2010 crisis, too, despite substantial government economic aid.EVALUATING THE PROCESSContrary to what many may believe, bankruptcy is not a death knell, particularly for public companies with a viable underlying business.For businesses that can make money, bankruptcy does not mean a shut-down and liquidation.With the proper resources, bankruptcy judges are extremely effective at restructuring such firms into viable, competitive companies.\u00a0Over the last few decades, for example, most US airlines have restructured in bankruptcy and emerged healthy.Moreover, bankruptcy allows small-business owners \u2013 say, failed restaurateurs \u2013 to put their debts behind them and start anew.\u00a0So, maintaining an effective bankruptcy system process is important for the US economy\u2019s health.READ:\u00a0Commentary: 10 signs a greater depression is comingREAD:\u00a0Commentary: Four things to help bring the best out of us this circuit breaker periodClogged bankruptcy courts will have a negative feedback effect on the economy. For starters, special procedures are needed for bankrupts to pay critical suppliers and sometimes employees.\u00a0If courts are backed up, these payments will be delayed, causing disruptions to ripple throughout supply chains.Furthermore, some bankruptcy decisions must be made almost immediately, so that businesses can get and keep enough cash to stay alive through their next payroll.One of us recently published a study showing that when bankruptcy courts become crowded, cases take longer to resolve, too many small businesses are liquidated, and creditors recover less of what they are owed.Worse, companies on the edge of bankruptcy a few months from now will have far too much debt to operate effectively.Over-indebted firms often refuse to, or cannot, pursue even good business projects, further reducing employment and investment.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe shutdown has seen huge chunks of the US economy grind to a halt AFP/Yuri DYACHYSHYN\n                            \n\n                    \n                Such over-indebted businesses can now restructure quickly in bankruptcy. But that will not be possible if courts are overloaded six months from now.As if all this were not enough, 65 per cent of US bankruptcy judges are older than 60. With coronavirus-related health reasons to work remotely, they will foregoing the \u201cin-chambers\u201d meetings where they often induce debtors and creditors to compromise.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Coronavirus crisis lays bare the risks of financial leverage, againREAD: Commentary: Life after COVID-19 \u2014 fashion's excesses curbed, shopping habits forever changedWhile this outlook is bleak, if historical pattern holds and bankruptcy filings peak several months after a recession begins, there is a window to act. If bankruptcies peak more quickly this time, there is no time to lose.The US Congress should double the number of available bankruptcy judges and support personnel.\u00a0In particular, legislators should create new, temporary judgeships, redeploying other federal judges, and moving bankruptcy judges in less busy courts to places where they are most needed.These are low-cost, high-return measures.\u00a0While the increasingly partisan nature of judicial nominations could make some in Congress hesitate, bankruptcy judges are appointed by federal appeals court judges, not by the president, and do not require the Senate\u2019s approval.Partisanship should not impede the expansion of bankruptcy courts\u2019 capacity.We need to strengthen that capacity now, just as we wish we had increased our health-care system\u2019s COVID-19 capacity months ago.The best solution to the threat of a bankruptcy overload is an early end to the public-health crisis and a rapid economic recovery.But we cannot count on that. We now have the lead time to secure the business equivalent of the missing virus tests and ventilators.

Saudi Arabia is the lowest-cost producer and has significant foreign currency reserves that allow it to ride out a price war better than most.But it was hurting all oil producers, including the US, and it eventually caused President Donald Trump to intervene.Around the same time, MBS reportedly detained two senior Saudis \u2013 the King\u2019s brother Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz and former Crown Prince Mohammad bin Nayef. The move showed that despite neutering many potential rival centres of power, a sense of insecurity remains about the formal accession of MBS to power.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nCrown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin Salman attends the 14th Islamic summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Mecca, Saudi Arabia Jun\u00a01, 2019.

He forged a close relationship with the Trump administration, whose focus on economic relations at the expense of pretty well anything else has allowed him a free hand to detain and eliminate political rivals and critics \u2013 even to effectively kidnap the Lebanese prime minister.The relationship MBS has with Jared Kushner is said to be particularly close.But this close relationship with the Trump administration has come at the expense of relations with Democrats, including the presidential candidates who publicly at least were highly critical of Saudi behaviour during the primaries.And the oil war has done little to endear Riyadh to the Hill.

But it is best used selectively and sparingly.THE UNILATERAL PURSUIT OF NATIONAL OBJECTIVESIn seeking to address long-term US (and European) grievances against certain Chinese trade practices, the Trump administration decided to abandon the traditional approach of seeking redress through existing multilateral institutions like the World Trade Organisation.Instead, it opted for what game theorists call a non-cooperative approach, imposing harsh tariffs on Chinese imports, and then threatening even more should China retaliate.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementREAD:\u00a0Commentary: The US-China tech rivalry is fracturing the world and affecting trade, firms and jobsBy weaponising what is traditionally an economic-policy tool, the US has been able to pursue national-security objectives alongside economic and financial goals.So far, at least, the underlying calculation has worked for Trump. Just like his unilateral push to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement, he has shown a willingness to tolerate some damage at home in the hope that the damage inflicted on the other parties would be far greater and force them to make concessions.The Reagan administration perfected this approach when it embarked on an accelerated arms race with the Soviet Union (or what Reagan labeled the \u201cevil empire\u201d).\n    AdvertisementIn ratcheting up defence spending, Reagan leveraged America\u2019s economic and financial strength in the knowledge that the Soviets could not possibly keep up.In the end, he secured not just a narrow tactical victory, but a wider geopolitical triumph, eventually culminating in the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse.THE COSTS OF A MAXIMUM-PRESSURE STRATEGYPressing an adversary into a corner in the hope that it will make a mistake is an old strategy. And as with any strategy, it comes with potential costs and risks.In Reagan\u2019s case, his administration had to bear the economic and political costs of creating large budget deficits, as well as the risk of a serious military confrontation with the Soviets.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said his country ratifying the modified version of the USMCA trade agreement December 12, 2019 is \"good news\".

China, however, initially reacted differently, and may have overplayed its hand.READ:\u00a0Commentary: The brewing discontent with trade and one step to restoring faith in globalisationBy prolonging trade tensions with the US through an extended tit-for-tat escalation of tariffs, the authorities allowed the economy to slow and prompted many companies to start diversifying their supply chains in an effort to reduce their reliance on China.The new mantra among a growing number of those operating in China reflects this: \u201cIn China, for China.\u201dThe immediate effect of these developments has been to complicate China\u2019s effort to implement the structural reforms needed to maintain its historic (if not unprecedented) rise. But over the longer term, the further-reaching effects of the trade war could increase the possibility that China will become ensnared in the middle-income trap, like so many developing countries before it.If that happens, the US will have managed to avert the global economy\u2019s full evolution from an American-led order to a bipolar one.THE SAME PLAY IN IRANAll of this takes us to Iran, where the Trump administration\u2019s recent confrontation seems to be following the same playbook. The pattern is clear: The administration takes a surprise step that its predecessors might have considered, but never pursued; it does so without wide internal and external consultations.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Why Iran won\u2019t seek direct confrontation with the USThe immediate result is a significant spike in tensions, with third countries (including allies) raising concerns about America\u2019s unilateralist turn. The adversary (in this case Iran) issues a response that, while less severe, leads it also to make a tragic mistake (the accidental downing of a civilian passenger flight).Now, even the European countries that had long sought to salvage the 2015 Iran nuclear deal are accusing Iran of violating that agreement.How this conflict will play out remains to be seen. But it is already clear that the US has made some gains, and that the greatest immediate risk \u2013 an outright war or a destabilising asymmetrical conflict \u2013 has been avoided, at least for now.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFlowers lie around a portrait of Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in an airstrike near Baghdad, at the Iranian embassy's fence in Minsk, Belarus January 10, 2020.

Excessive reliance on aggressive unilateralism risks dismantling an international architecture that has served US interests well.Moreover, the Trump administration\u2019s actions, if pressed too hard, could force third countries to make choices that run counter to US interests.READ:\u00a0Commentary: As Iran-US drama plays out, North Korea leader Kim Jong Un takes notesPROCEED WITH CAUTIONIn the end, aggressive unilateralism is not an approach that can be applied as a general rule.\u00a0It should be used in a highly selective and infrequent manner, and only after a careful assessment of the costs and benefits.Done right, it can help achieve targeted gains while containing collateral damage. But if it is abused, far-reaching unintended consequences could follow, implying ever-higher costs over time.Mohamed A El-Erian, Chief Economic Adviser at Allianz, was Chairman of US President Barack Obama\u2019s Global Development Council.

By no longer maintaining a specific oil-price band or retaining spare production capacity, the Kingdom is stepping away from its longstanding role as the market\u2019s swing producer.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementThe change reflects Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s (MBS) view that Saudi Arabia has a relatively narrow window of opportunity to monetize its large oil reserves.\u00a0He has embarked on a policy of capturing market share rather than trying to set the price, once again breaking with longstanding policies that he believes are no longer useful.THE BIG RISKS TO GLOBAL ENERGY MARKETSIf MBS persists with this strategy, he could significantly alter the dynamics of global energy markets. By keeping prices depressed, Saudi policy will not just drive more expensive forms of oil production out of the market; it will also make it harder for renewable energy to compete with fossil fuels \u2013 at least in the near term.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementREAD:\u00a0Commentary: Facing a two-front COVID-19 assault, Saudi Arabia pulls out the sledgehammerREAD:\u00a0Commentary: UAE fights COVID-19 while the rest of the Middle East drags its feetThe new strategy became clear on Mar 7, a Saturday, when Saudi Arabia decided to cut its official selling price and increase its oil production to above ten million barrels per day, with output in April likely to be near 11 million, up from 9.7 million in recent months.When markets reopened the following Monday, oil prices suffered their largest single-day decline since 1991.\n    AdvertisementOfficially, the Saudi action was a response to Russia\u2019s refusal to agree to voluntary oil production cuts at an OPEC+ meeting on Mar 6.Since 2016, the Russians and the Saudis have been coordinating their production to keep prices elevated at around US$50 to US$60 per barrel.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nA gas station worker wearing a protective face mask sits next to a petrol station, after Saudi Arabia imposed a temporary lockdown on the province of Qatif following the spread of coronavirus, in Qatif, Saudi Arabia on Mar\u00a09, 2020.

Commentators have offered various explanations, including the intimation that Saudi Arabia might be colluding with Russia to undermine the US shale industry.But such collaboration is highly unlikely. There is little trust between MBS and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has not forgotten that Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-market machinations in the 1980s may have played a role in the collapse of the Soviet Union.Moreover, Saudi Arabia already tried and failed to take on the shale industry in 2014 to 2016, when it badly underestimated US shale producers\u2019 technical competence and ability to operate at low prices.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Here's what G20 should be expected to do for the coronavirus outbreak this week. It won't be easyLISTEN: What's behind the different approaches countries are taking towards COVID-19?Rather than pursuing a short-term tactical win, MBS may instead be focusing on several longer-term development goals. He knows that he has only limited time \u2013 perhaps just a couple of decades \u2013 to extract maximum value from oil, because climate change has fueled a global push toward de-carbonisation and renewable energy.Saudi Arabia has well over 50 years\u2019 worth of recoverable reserves; most of that will become a stranded asset if it is not produced more quickly.Although the Kingdom will face serious technical and financial hurdles in pursuit of its new, highly ambitious production targets, the deeper point is that the old rules no longer apply.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nSaudi Arabia says it is to raise its already huge oil production capacity as a price war with Russia intensifies.

For starters, Saudi oil is cheaper to extract and transport than many other reserves. It is also \u201ccleaner\u201d than that produced by Canada\u2019s tar sands, and emits little methane compared to Russian oil.And Saudi Aramco is one of the world\u2019s most technologically advanced and technically competent oil companies.In other words, Saudi oil has multiple comparative advantages over the competition, and therefore is perfectly placed to hold a privileged position in the global clean-energy transition.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Big Oil talks a good low-carbon game but does little to back that upREAD:\u00a0Commentary: Saudi Aramco\u2019s US$1.5 trillion IPO flies in the face of realityMoreover, the Kingdom has been signaling its intended change in strategy for several months. In December 2019, it proceeded with the initial public offering of 1.5 per cent of Saudi Aramco, which represents one way of monetising the upfront value of its oil reserves, while also signaling the shift toward maximizing profit.After many years of disputes, the Saudis also have reached an agreement with Kuwait over oil production in the Neutral Zone, which will allow production to increase by up to 500,000 barrels per day.Lastly, Saudi Arabia recently announced plans to develop a massive unconventional gas field called Jafurah, which will make even more oil available for export.WARNING TO THE USThe Kingdom\u2019s policy shift should give pause to American politicians who boast that the United States has achieved energy independence through shale. In an all-out war for market share, US, Canadian, Russian, and other oil producers will have a hard time competing with the Gulf, given its lower costs and other competitive advantages.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nThe sun is seen behind a crude oil pump jack in the Permian Basin in Loving County, Texas, U.S. on, Nov22, 2019.

A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that it can hold out for two years.MBS may be gambling that he can outlast the competition. But given the structural features of the oil market and the world\u2019s inevitable transition to renewables, he probably sees no other alternative.OPEC quotas and production agreements with the Russians have not delivered the results he needs.

Meanwhile, China has been buying up Saudi and Russian oil on the uber cheap, while delaying on promises to buy US oil.Some say the Saudi-Russia price warriors miscalculated America\u2019s response.

She also accurately predicted Iran\u2019s measured response to Soleimani\u2019s killing.READ: Commentary: Why Iran won\u2019t seek direct confrontation with the USThe Washington Post confirmed that a second strike, authorised around the same time as the Soleimani strike, was carried out unsuccessfully against a top Iranian military official in Yemen.The news of this additional strike further undermined the Trump administration\u2019s assertion that Soleimani represented an imminent threat to the US, for which it claimed \u201cexquisite\u201d intelligence.It also suggests deep concerns about a coordinated effort among US adversaries in the region.TENSIONS LOWERED FOR THE MOMENTThe threat remains, but tensions have been lowered for the moment.Many of Trump\u2019s critics will focus on how considerations that would have prevented former presidents from taking action against Soleimani \u2013 the vulnerabilities of US allies in the region, rules against the targeted assassination of foreign government officials, and unpredictable second- and third-order effects \u2013 are meaningless to Trump.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA protester holds up a placard, dressed as US President Donald Trump in Trafalgar Square during a demonstration against the threat of war on Iran, in central London on January 11, 2020 AFP/Tolga Akmen\n                            \n\n                    \n                But this is also a moment to acknowledge the consequences of Congress\u2019s decades-long abdication of its powers in war-making.As illustrated by the impeachment clause, the possibility of an American president behaving like a monarch was anticipated by the Constitution\u2019s framers.

As the first woman and first African American ever elected as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney-general \u2014 as well as the first African American elected to the US Senate from the state \u2014 Harris has been a trailblazer for both women and African Americans.She also has first-hand experience with government policy aimed at addressing racial inequality in education.She will almost certainly be called the \u201claw and order\u201d candidate, and as has been seen in the Senate, her courtroom experience makes her a formidable public speaker.WHAT DOES HARRIS BRING TO THE CAMPAIGNThere are two groups of voters that Biden needs to win over: Whites and non-voters.During the 2016 presidential election, the PEW Research Centre found that 54 per cent of female voters voted for Hillary Clinton, compared to 38 per cent who voted for Trump.A look at the deeper demographic data shows 98 per cent of black women and 81 per cent of black men voted for Clinton, as did 66 per cent of Hispanics.What this means is that without a black or Hispanic candidate on the 2016 ticket, the Democrats still overwhelmingly won those voters. The campaign needs to win over more white voters and non-voters.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nVoters wearing face masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus wait to cast their ballots in a long line for presidential primary election voting in College Park, Maryland.

Clinton fared slightly better among white women, but more still voted for Trump \u2013 47 per cent to 45 per cent.In May, Biden pledged to name a woman as his running mate, and following the nationwide protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd, he came under immense pressure to choose a Black woman.Faced with a diametric decision, Biden\u2019s selection of Harris tells us his campaign has decided to focus on winning over non-voters. Non-voters are generally less white, younger and more likely to be women and favourable to Democrats.READ:\u00a0Commentary: A better version of America is emergingREAD:\u00a0Commentary: Ticket against Donald Trump in White House race missing boldest choiceBiden may bring in more white voters than Clinton anyway, given his background. Part of his appeal has long been his image as a \u201cregular Joe\u201d from a working-class upbringing. Where Barack Obama was sometimes viewed as aloof, Biden, his vice president, was seen by many as a link to the Democratic Party\u2019s blue-collar roots.Choosing which group of voters to target is always a gamble, however, because as we saw in 2016, Trump does not need to secure the most votes to win the election. The New York Times has suggested he could lose the popular vote by an even bigger margin in 2020 and still win.WHERE DOES THE CAMPAIGN GO FROM HERE?By having a woman on its last two presidential tickets, the Democratic Party is continuing its progressive political shift from the domain of white men \u2014 in contrast with Republicans.Vice presidential candidates have traditionally assumed the attack role in campaigns, allowing the presidential candidate to stay above the political fray, but Trump changed that.This campaign will be all about Trump, and much of Harris\u2019s focus \u2014 and her prosecutorial combativeness \u2014 will be aimed at him.This could prove challenging for the campaign, because as a woman, Harris will be held to a different standard than Trump, Biden and Vice President Mike Pence.\u00a0Her greatest challenge could be to overcome any backlash that comes from being too aggressive in her attacks against Trump \u2014 similar to what Clinton faced in 2016 \u2014 as well as the inevitable sexist media coverage about her clothes, appearance and demeanour.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) speaks to reporters about police reform legislation at the U.S. Capitol in Washington U.S., June 23, 2020.

The biggest criticism of John McCain\u2019s selection of Palin as his running mate in 2008 was that she was not ready to assume the presidency if needed.Few people will doubt Harris\u2019s capacity to do that should the need arise. And with 77-year-old Biden himself suggesting he may only serve a single term, his vice president could very well become the Democratic front-runner in 2024.Trump supporters are unwavering, though. Those who will vote for him on election day decided that a long time ago.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Could Donald Trump not run for re-election?READ:\u00a0Commentary: Kanye West for US president? Why celebrities becoming politicians is a bad ideaHarris will be tasked with endearing herself to voters who usually vote Republican but do not support Trump, encouraging them to vote for her party rather than stay home on election day.Harris is arguably the most formidable vice presidential nominee Biden could have chosen, and is undoubtedly the most experienced woman ever chosen for a vice presidential nominee.Despite the initial excitement around their selections, Ferraro and Palin were regarded as significant factors in the losses by the Democrats in 1984 and the Republicans in 2008, respectively.Now, Biden has to hope his pick proves to be a winning one.Bryan Cranston is Academic Teacher at the Swinburne University of Technology.\u00a0This commentary first appeared in The Conversation.\n      "},

Why were the oldest cities in the world surrounded by walls and watchtowers?\u201dNow, in this new age when terms such as \u201csocial distancing\u201d and \u201cmoist breath zone\u201d are part of the vernacular, Bondareva sees the challenge as one where the built environment is at the forefront of reinforcing public health, in a similar fashion to the way construction standards and other measures are recognised as important to mitigating climate change.READ: Commentary: The wonder of clear skies and returning wildlife is our new climate problemOUR SPACES DEFINE OUR HEALTHBondareva spoke to me from the US, where she works for building science consultants CETEC.

An opportunity was squandered. That was a quarter of a century ago.Under the Trump plan, the so-called two-state solution is dead for the foreseeable future given that Israel is allowed to annex territory under its control, including the Jordan Valley.ISRAEL\u2019S TERRITORIAL EXPANSIONIsrael has said it will move ahead with annexation as soon as this coming Sunday.At the same time, the Trump administration has\u00a0validated Israel\u2019s settlement-building on Palestinian land in the West Bank\u00a0by reversing longstanding US policy that regarded these settlements as a breach of international law.The Trump \u201cvision\u201d should also be viewed in the context of the US administration\u2019s unprecedented accommodation of an ultra-nationalist Israeli government\u2019s priorities.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nA tattered flag flies over the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) office in Washington.

Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab countries to have peace treaties with Israel.While Cairo\u2019s response \u2013 like that of Riyadh \u2013 to the Trump plan has been\u00a0muted, it is unlikely leaders of these two countries will risk demonstrations that would likely follow overt acceptance of arrangements inimical to Palestinian interests.In all of this, the year 1995 should be regarded as the reference point for any discussion of what lies ahead for the Palestinians and Israelis. That was the year a Jewish zealot\u00a0assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.The so-called peace process effectively died that day.Rabin\u2019s death and Netanyahu\u2019s subsequent election effectively stymied efforts to encourage a more constructive atmosphere in which compromise might be possible.A combination of Netanyahu\u2019s obduracy and a weak and divided Palestinian leadership has meant prospects for peace have gone backwards since Oslo in 1993.The\u00a0handshake on the White House lawn\u00a0between Palestine Liberation Organisation leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is a distant memory.The Trump plan is highly unlikely to reverse a continuing drift away from reasonable compromise. It risks making things worse, if that\u2019s possible.Tony Walker is Adjunct Professor at the School of Communications at La Trobe University.

But the Supreme Court has\u00a0recognised that a president may\u00a0shield\u00a0from disclosure certain sensitive information and communications to encourage candid advice from aides and to protect national security and other sensitive information.\u201cHowever busy or essential a presidential aide might be, and whatever their proximity to sensitive domestic and national-security projects, the President does not have the power to excuse him or her from taking an action that the law requires,\u201d Judge Jackson wrote.The case is now on appeal, and during oral argument in early January, the committee\u2019s lawyer said that\u00a0additional impeachment articles could be filed\u00a0based on McGahn\u2019s testimony.READ:\u00a0Commentary: The curious case of US presidents squandering power in the Middle EastIn 1974, in United States versus\u00a0Nixon, however, the court stated that the privilege is not absolute, and must yield in some circumstances, such as a criminal investigation. Absolute immunity, which courts have not recognised, goes even further than executive privilege, permitting an aide to refuse to appear altogether.Regardless of the outcome of the case, a court decision in the McGahn case will provide clarity that will weaken or strengthen the negotiating position of future presidents.SHOULD COURTS STEP INTO POLITICAL CONFLICTS?

United States\u00a0(no, not that Nixon, US District Judge Walter Nixon), the Supreme Court held that a federal judge could not appeal to a court seeking to overturn his conviction at a Senate impeachment trial. The Constitution, the court ruled, gives the Senate the sole power to try all impeachments.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Trump walks away clean from Soleimani falloutConcurring opinions in the Nixon case, however, left open the possibility of an appeal to courts for an impeachment trial that was conducted \u201carbitrarily,\u201d that is, lacking procedural fairness.Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, suggested at one time that Trump\u00a0file a court challenge to dismiss\u00a0the articles of impeachment.While that seems unlikely in light of the Nixon case, the political question doctrine is likely to figure in other pending cases, such the effort by Congress to seek grand jury material from Mueller\u2019s investigation.During oral argument earlier this month in the case over grand jury material pending before the court of appeals, one of the judges expressed reluctance to decide the case because it involves a political question.As the courts decide the cases involving McGahn\u2019s testimony, the Mueller grand jury material, and any challenge arising from Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, the contours of the political question doctrine will become more defined.WILL THE EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL BRANCHES COLLIDE?In the impeachment\u2019s aftermath, the extent of Congress\u2019 ability to serve as a valid check on presidential power will become clearer.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nDeputy White House Counsel Mike Purpura (C, bottom), makes arguments for the defense in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump AFP/HO\n                            \n\n                    \n                The framers of the Constitution envisioned\u00a0a Congress that would provide oversight over a president. They did not count on members of Congress having more loyalty to their party than to their institution.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Trump will make China great againIf the Senate were to acquit the president in the face of additional incriminating evidence, the institution\u2019s ability to serve as a credible check on future presidents could be damaged.The impeachment trial itself could cause all three branches to collide. Former national security adviser\u00a0John Bolton has publicly stated\u00a0that he would testify if subpoenaed by the Senate. Trump has said he would\u00a0invoke executive privilege to block\u00a0Bolton\u2019s testimony.If the Senate wanted to compel the testimony, the presiding Chief Justice John Roberts would decide the standoff between the president and the Senate. If he were to rule in favour of the Senate and order Bolton to testify, could President Trump appeal that decision to the Supreme Court?Would the Court be willing to decide such a political question about impeachment? Would the Senate arrest and jail a witness for refusing to testify?There are no rules for what happens then.Throughout his presidency, Trump has been a disrupter of normal procedures. It appears that he will continue that trend even after impeachment.Barbara L.

Unfortunately, even if the Greater Recession leads to a lacklustre U-shaped recovery this year, an L-shaped \u201cGreater Depression\u201d will follow later in this decade, owing to 10 ominous and risky trends.\u00a0DEBT AND FISCAL STRENGTHThe first trend concerns deficits and their corollary risks: debts and defaults.\u00a0The policy response to the COVID-19 crisis entails a massive increase in fiscal deficits \u2013 on the order of 10 per cent of GDP or more \u2013 at a time when public debt levels in many countries were already high, if not unsustainable.\u00a0\u00a0\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementWorse, the loss of income for many households and firms means that private-sector debt levels will become unsustainable, too, potentially leading to mass defaults and bankruptcies.\u00a0READ:\u00a0Commentary: Singapore\u2019s aviation and tourism recovery will be very slow after COVID-19 but long-term outlook remains brightREAD:\u00a0Commentary: The heavy lifting needed to get Singapore through the COVID-19 slumpTogether with soaring levels of public debt, this all but ensures a more anaemic recovery than the one that followed the Great Recession a decade ago.\n    AdvertisementA second factor is the demographic time bomb in advanced economies. The COVID-19 crisis shows that much more public spending must be allocated to health systems, and that universal health care and other relevant public goods are necessities, not luxuries.Yet, because most developed countries have ageing societies, funding such outlays in the future will make the implicit debts from today\u2019s unfunded health-care and social-security systems even larger.A third issue is the growing risk of deflation. In addition to causing a deep recession, the crisis is also creating a massive slack in goods - unused machines and capacity - and labour markets - mass unemployment - as well as driving a price collapse in commodities such as oil and industrial metals.That makes debt deflation likely, increasing the risk of insolvency.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nWith strict lockdowns still in force in many countries, there are fears about the time it will take for the global economy to recover AFP/Philip FONG\n                            \n\n                    \n                A fourth and related factor will be currency debasement. As central banks try to fight deflation and head off the risk of surging interest rates - following from the massive debt build-up - monetary policies will become even more unconventional and far-reaching.In the short run, governments will need to run monetised fiscal deficits to avoid depression and deflation.\u00a0READ:\u00a0Commentary: Coronavirus crisis lays bare the risks of financial leverage, againREAD:\u00a0Commentary: Singapore has a New Deal. We call it the Resilience BudgetYet, over time, the permanent negative supply shocks from accelerated de-globalisation and renewed protectionism will make stagflation all but inevitable.DISRUPTION OF SYSTEMSA fifth issue is the broader digital disruption of the economy.With millions of people losing their jobs or working and earning less, the income and wealth gaps of the 21st century economy will widen further.\u00a0To guard against future supply-chain shocks, companies in advanced economies will re-shore production from low-cost regions to higher-cost domestic markets.\u00a0But rather than helping workers at home, this trend will accelerate the pace of automation, putting downward pressure on wages and further fanning the flames of populism, nationalism, and xenophobia.This points to the sixth major factor: de-globalisation.The pandemic is accelerating trends toward balkanisation and fragmentation that were already well underway.\u00a0The United States and China will decouple faster, and most countries will respond by adopting still more protectionist policies to shield domestic firms and workers from global disruptions.\u00a0READ:\u00a0Commentary: Thailand has a cunning plan to kickstart the economy. It involves billionairesThe post-pandemic world will be marked by tighter restrictions on the movement of goods, services, capital, labour, technology, data, and information.This is already happening in the pharmaceutical, medical-equipment, and food sectors, where governments are imposing export restrictions and other protectionist measures in response to the crisis.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nMajor oil exporters have been battered by low demand as the coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc on the global economy AFP/GIUSEPPE CACACE\n                            \n\n                    \n                The backlash against democracy will reinforce this trend. Populist leaders often benefit from economic weakness, mass unemployment, and rising inequality.\u00a0Under conditions of heightened economic insecurity, there will be a strong impulse to scapegoat foreigners for the crisis.\u00a0Blue-collar workers and broad cohorts of the middle class will become more susceptible to populist rhetoric, particularly proposals to restrict migration and trade.IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL ORDERThis points to an eighth factor: the geostrategic standoff between the US and China. With the Trump administration making every effort to blame China for the pandemic, Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s regime will double down on its claim that the US is conspiring to prevent China\u2019s peaceful rise.The Sino-American decoupling in trade, technology, investment, data, and monetary arrangements will intensify.Worse, this diplomatic breakup will set the stage for a new cold war between the US and its rivals \u2013 not just China, but also Russia, Iran, and North Korea.With a US presidential election approaching, there is every reason to expect an upsurge in clandestine cyber warfare, potentially leading even to conventional military clashes.READ:\u00a0Commentary: A financial crisis is underway, as demand collapse ripples through companies across the worldAnd because technology is the key weapon in the fight for control of the industries of the future and in combating pandemics, the US private tech sector will become increasingly integrated into the national-security-industrial complex.PANDEMICS AND THE ENVIRONMENTA final risk that cannot be ignored is environmental disruption, which, as the COVID-19 crisis has shown, can wreak far more economic havoc than a financial crisis.Recurring epidemics - HIV since the 1980s, SARS in 2003, H1N1 in 2009, MERS in 2011, Ebola from 2014 to 2016 - are, like climate change, essentially man-made disasters, born of poor health and sanitary standards, the abuse of natural systems, and the growing interconnectivity of a globalised world.Pandemics and the many morbid symptoms of climate change will become more frequent, severe, and costly in the years ahead.These ten risks, already looming large before COVID-19 struck, now threaten to fuel a perfect storm that sweeps the entire global economy into a decade of despair.By the 2030s, technology and more competent political leadership may be able to reduce, resolve, or minimise many of these problems, giving rise to a more inclusive, cooperative, and stable international order.But any happy ending assumes that we find a way to survive the coming Greater Depression.BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the\u00a0coronavirus outbreak and its developmentsDownload our app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the COVID-19 outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramNouriel Roubini is CEO of Roubini Macro Associates and Professor of Economics at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business."},

In particular, the indebtedness of non-financial companies rose by 13 percentage points between September 2008 and December 2019, relative to global output.The indebtedness of governments, which assumed much of the post-financial crisis burden, rose by 30 percentage points. This shift on to the shoulders of governments will now happen again, on a huge scale.The IMF report gives a clear overview of the fragilities. Significant risks arise from asset managers as forced sellers of assets, leveraged parts of the non-financial corporate sector, some emerging countries, and even some banks.READ: Commentary: The heavy lifting needed to get Singapore through the COVID-19 slumpREAD: Commentary: The end of the decade \u2013 the world is in more debt and it isn\u2019t going awayWhile the latter are not the centre of this story, reasons for concern remain, despite past strengthening. This shock, the report states, is likely to be even more severe than envisaged in the IMF\u2019s stress tests.CAPITAL MARKETS THE TARGET THIS TIMEBanks remain highly-leveraged institutions, especially if we use market valuations of assets.As the report notes: \u201cMedian market-adjusted capitalisation is now higher than in 2008 only in the US.\u201d The chances that banks will need more capital is not small.Yet it is capital markets that lie at the heart of this saga.

(Photo: AFP/Filippo MONTEFORTE)\n                            \n\n                    \n                The Bank for International Settlements has studied one weird episode in mid-March when markets for benchmark government bonds experienced extraordinary turbulence.This happened because of the forced selling of Treasury securities by investors seeking \u201cto exploit small yield differences through the use of leverage\u201d. This is the type of \u201clong-short strategy\u201d made infamous by the failure of Long Term Capital Management in 1998.It is also a strategy vulnerable to rising volatility and declining market liquidity. These cause mark-to-market losses. Then, as margin is called in, investors are forced to sell assets to redeem loans.FUELED BY LOCAL CURRENCY BONDS AND PRIVATE EQUITYAnother story tells of emerging economies. An important recent development has been the rising use of local currency bonds to finance government spending.But when the prices of these bonds fell in the crisis, so did exchange rates, increasing the losses borne by foreign investors. These exchange-rate collapses worsen the solvency of domestic borrowers (notably businesses) with debts denominated in foreign currency.READ: Commentary: The brewing concern over jobs and salaries as COVID-19 persistsREAD: Commentary: COVID-19 collapse exceeds any recession in the last 150 yearsThe inability to borrow in domestic currency used to be called \u201coriginal sin\u201d. This has not gone, argue the BIS\u2019s Augustin Carstens and Hyun Song Shin. It has just \u201cshifted from borrowers to lenders\u201d.Yet another significant capital-market issue is the role of private equity and other high-leverage strategies in increasing expected returns, but also the risks, in corporate finance. Such approaches are almost perfectly designed to reduce resilience in periods of economic and financial stress.Governments and central banks have now been forced to bail them out, just as they were forced to bail out banks in the financial crisis. This will reinforce \u201cheads, I win; tails, you lose\u201d strategies.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe OECD estimates that if a financial shock arrived comparable to 2008 then US$500 billion worth of corporate debt would migrate to junk-rated levels within 12 months.

It has also demonstrated yet again the uncomfortably symbiotic relationship between the financial sector and the state.In the short run, we must try to get through this crisis with as little damage as possible. But we must also learn from it for the future.A systematic evaluation of the frailties of capital markets, comparable to what was done with banks after the financial crisis, is now essential. One issue is how emerging economies reduce the impact of the new version of \u201coriginal sin\u201d.READ:\u00a0Commentary: COVID-19 is reshaping what work looks likeREAD:\u00a0Commentary: COVID-19 has stripped work to bare bones - was all that excess needed anyway?Another is what to do about private sector leverage and the way in which risk ends up on governments\u2019 balance sheets. I think of this as trying to run capitalism with the least possible risk-bearing capital. It makes little sense.This creates a microeconomic task \u2014 eliminating incentives for the private sector to fund itself so heavily via debt; and a macroeconomic one \u2014 reducing reliance on debt to generate aggregate demand.The big question now is whether the essential systems that keep our societies running are adequately resilient. The answer is no.This is the sort of question the OECD\u2019s New Approaches to Economic Challenges Unit has dared to address. Inevitably, it has created much controversy. Yet it is admirable that an international organisation is daring to do so at all. The crisis has shown us why.We cannot afford complacency. We need to reassess the resilience of our economic, social and health arrangements. A focus on finance must be an important part of this effort.LISTEN: How many stars will you give Singapore\u00a0F&B\u00a0this COVID-19 season?BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the coronavirus outbreak and its developmentsDownload\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegram"},

HOW SAFE WILL IT BE?The bigger question, Dr Kim noted, is whether there will be \u201cenough safety data\u201d, as the final phase of human testing in the \u201cnormal development cycle\u201d of a vaccine is five to 10 years, instead of six months.WATCH: Is a safe COVID-19 vaccine by 2021 really possible? (6:05)The \u201cthousands\u201d of safety evaluations to be done this year will be a \u201cgood amount\u201d, although he acknowledged: \u201cWe aren\u2019t really going to be able to tell.\u201cIn the short term, to the point where the vaccine will either be given in emergency-use authorisation or an approval for market, we\u2019d have less long-term safety information than we normally have.\u201dSo vaccine developers should \u201cfollow the people who receive the vaccine and placebo for a much longer time than we normally do\u201d, he said, suggesting \u201ctwo or three years or longer\u201d.This is to ensure that there are no side effects \u201cat a very low level that we should be aware of, but that we can\u2019t because we\u2019re pushing hard to show that the vaccine works\u201d.Prof Ooi stressed: \u201cBetween being the first (to develop a vaccine) and getting it right, it\u2019s more important to get it right.\u201dBut he does not see speed and safety as \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d, and thinks \u201cwe can shrink the timeline\u201d for vaccine and drug development in general, which has been lengthened as more studies were added over the decades.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nProf Ooi Eng Eong is also a co-founder of biotechnology company Tychan, which developed the world\u2019s first Zika antibody in nine months.

WILL COUNTRIES HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO THE VACCINE?Much is at stake in the COVID-19 vaccine race, although it has to do not only with science, but also politics.The current US administration has already been accused of trying to monopolise first rights to vaccines being developed by a company in Germany and one in France \u2014 alleged attempts that the two European governments made sure to block.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA\u00a0person receiving\u00a0a vaccination against COVID-19\u00a0from German biotechnology company CureVac.

Countries that vaccinate first will \u201cget out of all the lockdowns\u201d and restrictions, return to normal economic activity and recover \u201cmuch faster\u201d than those without access to the vaccine.There are \u201cbound to be\u201d politics involved, said Mr Jain. \u201cPerhaps ... in the country where the vaccine development has taken place, the citizens of that country will demand that, first, the vaccine should be available in (their) country.\u201dBut with the vaccine development taking place across the world, he reiterated his belief that a handful of vaccines will emerge, which will \u201censure\u201d supply. There is also \u201ca lot of discussion\u201d about avoiding vaccine hoarding, he cited.\u201cThe dialogue will help us to ensure equitable distribution. It may not be 100 per cent perfect, but there\u2019s a lot of consciousness,\u201d he added. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019d like to find a level playing field.\u201dIn May, Chinese President Xi Jinping committed to making a Chinese vaccine available to all.But the question here, said Prof Joseph Liow, the dean of Nanyang Technological University\u2019s College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, is whether Beijing can win other countries\u2019 trust and show that it is extending this help \u201cin good faith\u201d and with \u201cno strings attached\u201d.WATCH: US-China rivalry politicises the COVID-19 vaccine race (5:00)Even if governments map out a plan to \u201cguarantee\u201d vaccines for \u201ca certain percentage of their need first\u201d, said Dr Kim, \u201cit may not be that much\u201d.\u201cI mean, who are the people in greatest need? It may be the elderly, healthcare workers or people with underlying conditions that make them more vulnerable to severe disease or death.\u201cMaybe that\u2019s 20 per cent of the population. So you don\u2019t need all of the vaccine all at once. You may want to just vaccinate the most vulnerable people first.\u201dREAD: Global recovery will come faster if COVID-19 vaccine available to all: WHO chief4. SO HOW SOON CAN EVERYONE GET VACCINATED?As someone with no comorbidities, or underlying diseases, Mr Jain does not expect to be a candidate for immunisation before the end of next year. That means vaccination for everyone only by 2022.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nOne of the COVID-19 vaccine candidates.\n                            \n\n                    \n                \u201cEven if we do the best (to ramp up production), I don\u2019t think we can see anything earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cThe capacity at the moment is limited ... It\u2019ll take time for production and distribution (to be ramped up).\u201dDr Kim noted that the US government is asking companies to start the manufacturing, seemingly \u201cplacing very educated bets on certain vaccines\u201d and de-risking the projects by giving the companies funding \u2014 which he hopes will also \u201cenable the companies to offer the vaccine at a lower cost\u201d.Organisations like the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations are doing the same, including trying to secure manufacturing facilities down to the glass vials for the vaccines. The coalition has identified the need to have vaccine capacity for 10 billion doses.\u201cThere is a manufacturing capacity out there. And the real question will be how quickly can we mobilise it,\u201d said Dr Kim.\u201cCountries and companies are already making contracts with different organisations (and) manufacturers to be able to ensure that the vaccine is made ... (but) we\u2019ve never undertaken something like this before.\u201dIf 60 to 70 per cent of people need to be vaccinated to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d, that may mean \u201cvaccinating in the order of four billion to six billion people\u201d.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nHydroxychloroquine, convalescent plasma and herd immunity are among some of the once-obscure terms becoming household words in the coronavirus era.

That\u2019s a huge number,\u201d he said, adding that getting up to those numbers over the next 12 months \u201cwould be a stretch\u201d.5. WILL A VACCINE MEAN A RETURN TO NORMAL?All things considered, Mr Jain doubts that life will return to normal in the first year of discovering a vaccine.\u201cHence it\u2019s very important that all of us have to be cautious. All of us have to wear masks ... behave with social distancing, and then the whole process will evolve over a period of time,\u201d he said.Most experts agree that a vaccine will not get rid of the coronavirus. \u201cToo many people are now infected with Sars-CoV-2 that it won\u2019t disappear,\u201d said Prof Ooi.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nSwabbing for testing has become ubiquitous in the coronavirus era too.\n                            \n\n                    \n                Citing another reason the coronavirus is here to stay, he added: \u201cIt came from an animal, and we can\u2019t vaccinate all the animals, especially the wild animals.\u201cSo we\u2019ll have this virus, and occasionally it\u2019ll spill over and cause outbreaks, especially when vaccination rates are low. And that would be the challenge.\u201dPeople may have to also accept that the first vaccine put into use \u201cmight not even be able to prevent infection\u201d, said Prof Jin Dong-Yan from the University of Hong Kong's School of Biomedical Sciences.\u201cBut if it could prevent severe disease and ... not have a major adverse effect, that\u2019s already good enough,\u201d he told Insight.Virology professor Ian Jones from the University of Reading in the UK noted that the data released so far indicates that the experimental vaccines protect against COVID-19 but may not give the \u201csterilising immunity\u201d to stop an infection altogether.\u201cThe problem with that would be that someone who\u2019s vaccinated could still be infected and could then spread the virus, so it\u2019s not the perfect solution,\u201d he told Insight.Even so, he views the development of a vaccine as \u201cthe most useful way forward\u201d.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n\n                    \n                \u201cWhat we're aiming for is a vaccine that takes away the fear of the disease,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you get vaccinated, and you\u2019re pretty confident that you're not going to die, then I don't think people will worry too much.\u201dAnd of all the solutions to the pandemic, a vaccine is \u201cprobably the most cost-effective\u201d, believes Dr Kim. \u201cA vaccine is the one potential intervention that\u2019ll get us back to something similar to what we had before,\u201d he said.How similar will depend \u201ca little bit on the qualities of the vaccine\u201d and also on \u201cseveral of the unknown things about the virus and viral infection in the population\u201d.\u201cWe\u2019ve learned a tremendous amount in six and a half months, but it\u2019s not enough,\u201d he noted.Assuming vaccination rates are at 60 to 70 per cent five years from now, however, then he would say \u201cwe\u2019ve protected the population from the consequences of an outbreak\u201d.\u201cYou\u2019ll see an occasional COVID-19 infection that\u2019ll look like someone has a fever and maybe some cough or shortness of breath. You\u2019ll test them, and you\u2019ll find COVID. But it won\u2019t spread in the population because enough people are immune.\u201dFor now, the \u201cbread and butter\u201d is safe distancing, a high level of hygiene \u201cand all that\u201d, said Prof Ooi. \u201cThen you overlay that (with) vaccines and drugs. Then we have a chance of really overcoming this virus.\u201dThe programme Insight airs on Thursdays at 9pm, and In Conversation airs every Wednesday at 9pm."},

As COVID-19 has brought the global economy to a standstill, with planes sitting on runways and cars idle in the garage, demand for oil has plunged.But it is not easy for oil producers to turn off the tap, so they need somewhere to store it until they can find a buyer.READ: Commentary: Even with low prices, this is not the end of oil\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementThe problem is there is very little storage left so producers are literally paying buyers to take it off their hands, hence the negative prices we witnessed today in the US.But don\u2019t expect to be paid the next time you fill up your car at the petrol station.A SECURITY LENSHowever, if we view oil from a security lens, the picture looks quite different. For many nations energy security has been defined in terms of access to reliable and affordable oil and gas.\n    AdvertisementSo low prices are generally good for big consumers, such as China, and bad for big producers such as Saudi Arabia, or more lately the United States.READ: Commentary: Saudi Arabia's new, radical oil strategy aims to keep prices low\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nOil prices have ended New York trading in the negative for the first time ever AFP/Loren ELLIOTT\n                            \n\n                    \n                Security scholars have argued that the US shale revolution \u2013 the technology breakthroughs that have allowed producers to access the vast onshore oil and gas reserves and turn the US into the largest producer in the world \u2013 will boost American power and transform energy politics in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East to America\u2019s advantage.However, sustained low oil prices threatens to send some US shale producers to the wall, which could hamper the US oil sector and limit the geopolitical leverage of the US in these regions \u2013 although Donald Trump is doing a pretty good job of that himself.READ:\u00a0Oil in the age of coronavirus: a US shale bust like no otherWHO GOVERNS OIL?Finally, rather than focusing on markets as economists do, or energy security as security scholars do, we can also ask an entirely different question: Who is governing global oil markets?This is an important one because it draws our attention to the various international organisations and multinational oil companies that also govern oil at the global level.READ:\u00a0OPEC+ or minus?

The hermit kingdom\u2019s state media has not mentioned the US-Iran discord.DISTRUST, DETERRENCE AND THE LIMITS OF AGREEMENTSDespite their outward silence, Pyongyang\u2019s power elite are no doubt monitoring developments in the Middle East and taking notes.One lesson they may be taking is the potential impermanence of a nuclear deal with the US.In 2015, Iran signed a deal with the US, France, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and Germany that mandated restrictions on Iran\u2019s ability to enrich uranium and required inspections by external monitors. In response, the other countries agreed to lift sanctions on Iran.Despite Iran having stuck to the terms of the deal, the US officially withdrew from the agreement in 2018, with President Donald Trump saying it had been a disadvantageous deal for the US.READ:\u00a0Commentary: \u00a0Why Iran won\u2019t seek direct confrontation with the USREAD:\u00a0Commentary: Will a US president facing impeachment manufacture a foreign policy crisis?Since then, Washington and Tehran have slid deeper into antagonism, culminating in the recent killing of Soleimani, who was arguably the most important operative in the Middle East.LIMITS OF COMPARISON BETWEEN IRAN AND NORTH KOREANow is a good time to point out that Iran and North Korea are different in important ways.The latest flare-up is part of a decades-long chess match between Iran and the US seeking control of the strategically vital Middle East.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump holds up a proclamation declaring his intention to withdraw from the JCPOA Iran nuclear agreement in Washington, U.S. May 8, 2018.

Had he kept his nukes, the line of thinking goes, he could have stayed in power and his people would have been safe and independent.THE DANGER OF DRONESThere is another unnerving wrinkle to the past week's events: With the killing of Soleimani, the US displayed a willingness to carry out targeted drone attacks of top officials.Don\u2019t test our tolerance for aggression because we will respond decisively: The signal may have been primarily intended for Iran but the message no doubt was also received by North Korea.At this point it is most likely that North Korea will bide its time, and that instead of carrying a provocation to get Washington's attention, it will look to continue developing weapons, improving its technology with the goal of one day being recognised as a nuclear power.READ:\u00a0Commentary: The man who took the biggest bet on North Korea leader Kim Jong Un\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nIf Kim Jong Un feels he has succeeded in his quest to build a nuclear weapon, some experts believe he may be open to talks to end his dangerous stand-off with the United States.

Other large public oil companies such as Shell typically pay shareholders a dividend of 6 per cent on their investment value.If Aramco pays a similar percentage and its total dividends reach around US$75 billion, then the actual value of the company could be closer to US$1.25 trillion.Of course that would still make the company the most valuable in the world.

This means they could be worth much less than investors expected and perhaps even become worthless.Global investors are not looking to increase the proportion of their portfolios devoted to oil and gas firms.

North Korea promised \"merciless\" retaliation when it learned a Hollywood movie about killing Kim Jong Un was going to be released.\u00a0READ:\u00a0Commentary: Kim Jong Un is using North Korea's nuclear capabilities for extortionREAD:\u00a0Commentary: The man who took the biggest bet on North Korea leader Kim Jong UnWhen The Interview came out, North Korea launched a cyberattack against the Hollywood studio in charge of the movie in retaliation.Possibly in recognition of\u00a0the family\u2019s obsession with cinema, when they met in Singapore, Donald Trump screened a Hollywood-type movie trailer showing the potential for North Korea if it were to agree to a treaty with the US committing to denuclearisation.THE BIGGER FOREIGN POLICY RISKWith a Senate impeachment trial potentially kicking-off in January, the bigger foreign policy risk is this: Will Kim Jong Un see Donald Trump as vulnerable, change his tactics and try to take advantage of the situation?\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nIf Kim Jong Un feels he has succeeded in his quest to build a nuclear weapon, some experts believe he may be open to talks to end his dangerous stand-off with the United States.

Some vaccines are currently in early-stage trials, but that timeline would still be very optimistic.\n    AdvertisementHowever, it is important to remember that a vaccine is like many other products: What matters is not just that the product is available but also how effective it is.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nSmall bottles labeled with a \"Vaccine COVID-19\" sticker and a medical syringe are seen in this illustration taken taken on Apr\u00a010, 2020.

Scientists talk about this as the vaccine\u2019s efficacy or effectiveness.If 100 people who haven\u2019t been exposed to the virus are given a vaccine that has an efficacy of 80 per cent, that means that on average 80 of them would not get infected.The difference between efficacy and effectiveness is that the former applies when vaccination is given under controlled circumstances, like a clinical trial, and the latter is under \u201creal-world\u201d conditions. Typically, a vaccine\u2019s effectiveness tends to be lower than its efficacy.READ: Commentary: The road to a COVID-19 vaccine is long and narrowingREAD: Commentary: The systematic testing Singapore needs to ditch circuit breakers for goodCOMPUTER SIMULATIONSSince COVID-19 coronavirus vaccines are still under development, now is the time to set vaccine efficacy levels to aim for, as well as to manage expectations. Running computer simulations is really the only way to ethically do this.Typically, in an epidemic or pandemic, as more people are exposed to the virus, the number of new infections per day steadily increases until it reaches a peak and begins to drop. Of course, how long this takes depends upon how the virus and the response to it may evolve over time.To stop the pandemic, the number of new infections per day needs to drop to zero, or at least to a very low number, as quickly as possible.If the COVID-19 pandemic were just beginning and the population infected was close to 0 per cent, the simulations show that vaccine efficacy would have to be at least 60 per cent to stop the coronavirus if the entire population was vaccinated.Given the number of susceptible people who couldn\u2019t be vaccinated because of age or health problems and the number who would refuse to be vaccinated, that\u2019s probably impossible.READ: Commentary: Here's how our elderly can better protect themselves against COVID-19\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n(Graphic: Bruce Y Lee)\n                            \n\n                    \n                If only 75 per cent of the population gets vaccinated, the vaccine efficacy would have to be around 70 per cent. If only 60 per cent of people get vaccinated, the threshold goes even higher, to around 80 per cent. It\u2019s all about making sure the virus can\u2019t find more people to infect.Those numbers assume that a person infected with the virus infects 2.5 other people on average. If the virus is more contagious, the vaccine has to be more efficient.Now, the further along the pandemic is, the less the height of the peak can be reduced. It\u2019s like climbing a mountain \u2013 you are already at a certain height. Plus, it is harder to shut a pandemic down when there are more infectious people running around.So, when 5 per cent of the population has already been infected with the virus, the best that you can do is reduce the peak by around 85 per cent. The difference between 0 per cent and 5 per cent can add up to millions of infections.So far, about 1 per cent of the US population has been confirmed to have been infected, but officials estimate the actual percentage is much higher.READ: Commentary: The US was just not built to handle COVID-19READ: Commentary: When economies reopen for business but families are reluctant to spend\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n(Graphic: Bruce Y Lee)\n\n                            \n\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n(Graphic: Bruce Y Lee)\n\n                            \n\n                    \n                BETWEEN 60 PER CENT AND 80 PER CENT EFFECTIVEBased on these findings, a vaccine with an efficacy as low as 60 per cent could still stop the pandemic and allow society to return to normal. However, most if not all of the population would have to be vaccinated.This seems unlikely, given polls showing that only about three-quarters of Americans say they would get a coronavirus vaccine if assured that it was safe.With fewer people protected, a vaccine would have to have an efficacy of at least 80 per cent to be able to stop the pandemic by itself, meaning social distancing could be completely relaxed. This can provide a target to aim for when developing COVID-19 coronavirus vaccines.Again, all of this doesn\u2019t mean that a vaccine with a lower efficacy would not be useful. It would mean that social distancing and mask-wearing likely would have to continue until the pandemic runs its course or a vaccine that is actually \u201cgood enough\u201d arrives.BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the coronavirus outbreak and its developmentsDownload\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegramBruce Y Lee is Professor of Health Policy and Management at the City University of New York.

However, while upholding the ban on assassination, the Ronald Reagan administration worked to create the legal and political space it needed to kill terrorists when it saw fit.Legal opinions from the CIA and the Pentagon at the time suggested using force in counter-terrorism was a different matter altogether and so fell outside the remit of the ban on assassination.A key element of the Reagan administration\u2019s justification, as made clear in National Security Decision Directive 138, was that these measures were pre-emptive and were taken in self-defence, against targets that posed an imminent threat to US interests and personnel.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Will a US president facing impeachment manufacture a foreign policy crisis?In an important precedent for the Soleimani killing, some members of the Reagan administration also argued that not only terrorists, but also leaders of states supporting terrorism, could be targeted.On this basis, while some disagreement remains, several primary and secondary sources seem to agree that the Reagan administration tried to kill Libyan leader Muhammar Gaddafi in an air strike on his headquarters and home in 1986. Gaddafi survived the bombing.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nLibya's late leader Muammar Gaddafi, pictured in Rome in 2009.

The number of drone strikes increased markedly during Barack Obama\u2019s first term in particular.In his second term, however, Obama made an admittedly late and somewhat unconvincing effort to better align US counter-terrorism policy to international legal standards for the use of force in self-defence.This effort relied in part on the argument that the terrorists targeted posed an imminent threat to the US. In this effort, however, the Obama administration adopted a very relaxed standard of imminence.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Why Soleimani assassination risks all-out war between the US and IranThe legal justification has set international precedents that other states (like Turkey and Pakistan) have been more than happy to follow.The drone strike that killed Soleimani, however, goes even beyond recent US policy and seems to make explicit a view that had remained somewhat implicit in the Reagan years.US practice had largely established that the ban on assassination did not apply to non-state terrorist actors who posed an imminent threat. Soleimani was in charge of the undeclared proxy war between the US and Iran.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nFlag-draped coffins of General\u00a0Qasem Soleimani and his comrades who were killed in Iraq in a US drone\u00a0strike, are carried on a truck in southwestern city of Ahvaz, Iran.

General Soleimani also approved the attacks on the US embassy in Baghdad.But there is no detailed evidence of why he posed an imminent threat.

In fact, COVID-19 might turn out to be the catalyst that finally brings digital payments fully into the mainstream.Not surprisingly, the digital-payments industry is already focusing on the opportunities created by the crisis.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementChina\u2019s government, for its part, has begun to disinfect and even destroy banknotes to mitigate the spread of the virus, at least in the short run.\u00a0SCMP reported that a local branch of the People\u2019s Bank of China in Guangdong province has been destroying money that may have circulated through high-risk settings such as hospitals and food markets.For fear of importing contaminated currency from Asia, the US Federal Reserve has initiated quarantine measures for physical dollars from the region.READ: Commentary: Even with near-zero interest rates, a global economic recession is almost certain \n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementREAD: Commentary: What elections in a coronavirus outbreak could look likeSuch actions are probably justified, considering that currency in circulation can indeed serve as a vehicle for transmitting pathogens \u2013 much like a mosquito.\u00a0Studies have found that the human influenza virus, for example, can remain alive and infectious on banknotes for 17 days. It would thus not be unreasonable to assume that physical currency has played a role in spreading COVID-19 as well.In any case, many countries will be weighing the option of disinfecting, destroying, and reprinting currency. Whatever they decide, one outcome already seems certain: The coronavirus will accelerate an ongoing shift among younger populations toward digital payments, particularly in Asia, and specifically in China.\n    AdvertisementTHE DIGITAL SHIFTThis trend towards digital payments is already strong. As of the end of 2018, around 73 per cent of Internet users in China used online payments services (up from 18 per cent in 2008).Young populations tend to be more open to adopting new technologies, and China and Southeast Asian countries have significantly younger populations than Europe and the United States.READ: Commentary: No ordinary disruption \u2013 a rising generation meets the coronavirus\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nA woman wearing protective mask and gloves, uses her phone in a Mass Rapid Transit train, during the movement control order due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia March 22, 2020. REUTERS/Lim Huey Teng\n                            \n\n                    \n                Moreover, the Chinese government actively promotes its online banking infrastructure, whereas Western countries rarely use a top-down approach to governance, and have lagged behind Asian economies in adopting digital payments.There are internal and structural reasons for Western countries\u2019 slower adoption rates. For example, Europe doesn\u2019t have any large technology or financial companies involved in the digital-payments sector.\u00a0European consumers and businesses must therefore rely on services offered by large US companies \u2013 Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, and so forth.But, owing to concerns about ceding critical sectors of the digital economy to US tech giants, the European Union has been taking a slower, more careful approach, favoring those changes that are least disruptive to the European financial-transaction infrastructure.READ: Commentary: Big Tech is showing some love to the US government \u2013 which comes as no surpriseCultural habits have also slowed the pace of change in the West. Americans and Western Europeans, in particular, are much more dependent on cash than are households in Asia.According to a recent survey by Deutsche Bank, one-third of respondents in developed economies consider cash to be their favorite payment method, and more than half believe that cash will always be around. Changing such culturally ingrained habits without risking public blowback takes time.READ: Commentary: On sick leave, but China still makes great leap forward in Med TechA TURNING POINTStill, the global spread of COVID-19 might be moving the world toward a turning point in how it handles payments. It is too early to predict what changes might be coming, but they are likely to emerge as solutions to specific challenges within different national contexts, payment infrastructures, and demographic groups.Digital versions of cash currency, such as Sweden\u2019s recently announced e-krona, are promising examples of what could be in store.LISTEN: Will you give an e-hongbao instead of cash?\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nPeople wear masks as a preventive measure against COVID-19 as they look at their mobile phones while waiting at a food stall on a street in Beijing,\u00a0China.

Digital wallets are free and easily available.Going digital could also help track spending and manage budgets. In terms of security, going cashless reduces the chances of being physically robbed.READ: Commentary: Don't carry your bank cards with your mobile phoneTo be sure, the current crisis has not yet led many countries other than China to disinfect, destroy, and reprint their currencies. But COVID-19 could turn out to be a once-in-a-century pandemic, as Bill Gates recently warned in a commentary for the New England Journal of Medicine.A once-in-a-century pathogen would demand once-in-a-century solutions.

It had seemed nearly impossible for public health officials to know how effective this measure and others have been in slowing the coronavirus.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementBut the new data offers evidence, in real time, that tight social-distancing restrictions may be working, potentially reducing hospital overcrowding and lowering death rates, experts said.The company, Kinsa Health, which produces Internet-connected thermometers, first created a national map of fever levels on Mar\u00a022 and was able to spot the trend within a day. Since then, data from the health departments of New York state and Washington state have buttressed the finding, making it clear that social distancing is saving lives.READ:\u00a0US coronavirus death toll rises past 3,000 on deadliest dayThe trend has become so obvious that on Sunday, President Donald Trump extended until the end of April his recommendation that Americans stay in lockdown. Trump had hoped to lift restrictions by Easter and send Americans back to work.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\u201cThat would have been the worst possible Easter surprise,\u201d said Dr. Peter J.

Since 2018, when it had more than 500,000 thermometers distributed, its predictions have routinely been two to three weeks ahead of those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which gathers flu data on patient symptoms from doctors\u2019 offices and hospitals.To identify clusters of coronavirus infections, Kinsa recently adapted its software to detect spikes of \u201catypical fever\u201d that do not correlate with historical flu patterns and are likely attributable to the coronavirus.READ:\u00a0Trump says COVID-19 guidelines may get tougher; 1 million Americans testedAs of noon Wednesday, the company\u2019s live map showed fevers holding steady or dropping almost universally across the country, with two prominent exceptions.One was in a broad swath of New Mexico, where the governor had issued stay-at-home orders only the day before, and in adjacent counties in southern Colorado.The second was in a ring of Louisiana parishes surrounding New Orleans, but 100 to 150 miles away from it. That presumably was caused by the outward local spread of the explosion of infections in New Orleans, which officials believe was set off by crowding during Mardi Gras.By Friday morning, fevers in every county in the country were on a downward trend, depicted in four shades of blue on the map.Fevers were dropping especially rapidly in the West, from Utah to California and from Washington down to Arizona; in many Western counties, the numbers of people reporting high fevers fell by almost 20%. The numbers were also declining rapidly in Maine.The parts of New Mexico and Colorado that had been slightly \u201cwarm\u201d on Wednesday were in light blue, indicating that they were cooling. So were the Louisiana counties.As of Monday morning, more than three-quarters of the country was deep blue. A separate display of the collective national fever trend, which had spiked upward to a peak on Mar\u00a017, had fallen so far that it was actually below the band showing historical flu fever trends -\u00a0which meant that the lockdown has cut not only COVID-19 transmission but flu transmission, too.\u201cI\u2019m very impressed by this,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine expert at Vanderbilt University. \u201cIt looks like a way to prove that social distancing works.\u201d\u201cBut it does shows that it takes the most restrictive measures to make a real difference,\u201d he added.Explore: Interactive map of all the confirmed cases reported around the worldFor some hard-hit cities, Kinsa also sent The New York Times fever data plotted on a timeline of restrictions enacted by mayors or governors.Those graphs, Schaffner noted, showed that simply declaring a state of emergency or limiting the size of public gatherings did not affect the number of people reporting fevers.But closing restaurants and bars and asking people to stay in their homes produced dramatic results in all three cities.For example, in Manhattan, reports of fevers steadily rose during early March, despite a declaration of emergency on Mar 7 and an order on Mar\u00a012 that public gatherings be restricted to less than 500 people.The turning point began on Mar 16, the day schools were closed. Bars and restaurants were closed the next day, and a stay-at-home order took effect on Mar 20. By Mar 23, new fevers in Manhattan were below their Mar 1 levels.Last Friday, New York state\u2019s own data showed the same trend that Kinsa\u2019s fever readings had spotted five days earlier.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA long queue forms, as people wait to be tested for coronavirus outside of Elmhurst Hospital in New York.

So many patients were being admitted to New York City hospitals, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said, that until Mar 20, hospitalisation rates were doubling roughly every two days.By Tuesday, the hospitalisation rate took four days to double. This is roughly what the fever readings predicted, said Nita Nehru, a company spokeswoman.Hospitalisations occur several days after symptoms like fever appear. \u201cThe cases being counted now had fevers five to 10 days ago,\u201d she said.The slowing of new hospital admissions \u201csuggests that our density-control measures may be working,\u201d Cuomo said Wednesday.\u201cPeople say these requirements -\u00a0no restaurants, no nonessential workers -\u00a0are burdensome,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u00a0are\u00a0burdensome. But they are effective, and they are necessary. The evidence suggests that they have slowed our hospitalisations, and that is\u00a0everything.\u201dREAD: New York cheers arrival of hospital ship as coronavirus cases soarShown the Kinsa data, Dr. Howard Zucker, New York state\u2019s health commissioner, called it \u201ca great example of technology being able to show what we think we\u2019re experiencing -\u00a0and it\u2019s consistent with our data.\u201dOn Friday, the University of California, San Francisco, said its hospitals were not facing a huge surge of patients and gave the credit to the strict shelter-in-place orders imposed by Mayor London Breed on Mar 16.On Sunday, Washington state also reported a downward trend following the imposition of its restrictions, based on data from deaths, coronavirus tests and information about people\u2019s movements from the Facebook apps on their cellphones.\u201cPeople need to know their sacrifices are helping,\u201d said Inder Singh, founder of Kinsa. \u201cI\u2019ve had friends text or call and say: \u2018Inder, this seems overblown. I\u2019m sitting at home by myself, I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s sick, why am I doing this?\u2019\u201dKinsa\u2019s tracking of fevers in Miami-Dade County in Florida showed an even more pronounced trend, and the company had tried to raise the alarm.In early Mar, Florida beaches and bars were packed with spring break revelers, despite warnings that crowding was dangerous. On Kinsa maps that normally look for flu trends, fever levels were soaring.Singh tried to get the word out, but the San Francisco-based company is relatively obscure and almost no one paid attention.\u201dIt was so frustrating,\u201d said Nehru, the company spokeswoman. \u201cFor three days from about Mar 19 on, Inder was calling local government folks in Florida, The Tampa Bay Times and other papers.

Closing local schools on Mar 16 had little effect.But on Mar 18, Miami\u2019s bars and restaurants were closed, and within two days reports of fevers started to drop sharply, according to Kinsa\u2019s data.But the damage may have been done. Now Florida is reporting that coronavirus cases are soaring, and its hospitals expect to be overwhelmed.The dropping fever trend does not mean cases or hospitalisations will also drop immediately, Nehru pointed out.Confirmed cases will keep going up for days, because people do not always go for a COVID-19 test the same day they feel feverish. Besides, many states are doing more tests every day.The CDC has declined to comment whenever it is asked about the company.Singh said he had approached the CDC about using his data as part of its own flu surveillance, but agency officers had insisted on him giving up the rights to his data if they did, and he refused.Schaffner, an adviser to the CDC on flu surveillance, said he was disappointed to hear that and would look into it.The refinement Kinsa made on Mar 22 was to add \u201ctrends\u201d -\u00a0a map showing whether all fevers were increasing, decreasing or holding steady.\u201cFinally, people are asking us for our data,\u201d Singh said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re talking with six states about them distributing more thermometers.

And we may not have seen the worst of it yet.The remarkable collapse of talks between major oil producers, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia in March had contributed to the perfect storm, with a competitive surge in production expected at a time where the continued spread of coronavirus COVID-19 is resulting in drastic falls in oil demand. In retaliation against Russia, Saudi Arabia ramped up supply driving prices downwards as crude oil prices fell to 18-year lows.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementThe global landscape is so volatile that even as we write this piece, there is a niggling sense of uncertainty.

China, the world\u2019s second largest consumer and biggest source of oil growth, experienced an estimated fall in demand of 400,000 barrels per day at the height of its social distancing policies. As infection rates continue to accelerate across the US, Europe and Asia, projections for where and when this demand drop might end are uncertain.Today, the industry faces a triple shock of reduced demand, increased supply and a shortage of storage capacity to take up excess supply. All of this points to a sustained lower oil price for at least the next 12-18 months.These remarkable shocks come at a time when oil is battling an already hostile landscape. The ongoing energy transition has gained significant momentum in recent years, with growing focus on climate action, driving greater competition for capital between renewables and the fossil fuel industry.

Aviation biofuel remains too expensive to be competitive.Electric air travel would require a significant revolution in the power density of batteries. Such alternatives are unlikely to emerge rapidly over the next five to10 years.In road transport, electric vehicles (EVs) will continue to gain traction in global markets. Yet falling oil prices may slow this transition, as lower petrol prices at the pump impact the commercial challenge of EVs. Policy measures and tax reliefs may go some way to addressing that, but ultimately result in shifting the costs from consumers to taxpayers.While the fundamentals remain sound, there is no doubt that the extremity of current circumstances could challenge the status quo in the existing landscape.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Facing a two-front COVID-19 assault, Saudi Arabia pulls out the sledgehammerReports suggest Russia is prepared for a price war that sees oil prices hovering between US$25-US$30 in the mid-term.

The uncertainty of COVID-19 disruption to production aside, this challenging economic landscape could result in some shale gas operators going out of business.Yet while individual operators may face insolvency, the underlying value of their assets will remain. The likelihood is more cost-competitive operators would acquire those assets and continue production. The US oil industry has consistently demonstrated innovation in driving efficiencies and reducing costs.That is likely to continue as long as there is profit to be made and as long as there is additional investment to be found.There is no doubt that some US shale operators are significantly exposed during this period of drastic oil price reduction. Several highly leveraged players are at risk of not surviving a period of prolonged low oil prices.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nRiyadh faces pressure from Washington to row back on its decision to hike oil production and offer the biggest price cuts in two decades AFP/Bandar AL-JALOUD\n                            \n\n                    \n                Yet the impact across the industry will vary. Independents and mid-cap players with strong balance sheets may benefit from acquiring distressed assets at a significant discount. Major oil companies with global portfolios could look to doubling down on shale exposure as a structurally lower costing resource.READ:\u00a0Commentary: The world\u2019s airlines are headed for a crash landing. Government parachutes need to be activated nowThere is another wild card on the horizon for the US shale industry of course \u2014 the question of the 2020 United States presidential election.\u00a0Not only is the impact of recent economic shocks likely to prove a contentious point within the electorate, but the question of which candidate the industry feels will most bolster them during challenging times will loom over proceedings. It may well be they commit to an existing administration that has shown abundant fondness for oil and gas.The ultimate duration of this period of low oil prices remains uncertain. Our research suggests both Saudi Arabia and Russia can sustain a low-price landscape for a year or so. Establishing a willingness to make personal sacrifices in the name of victory could well be a bargaining chip that both players bring back to the table. The question of when parties go back to that table is another point entirely.PLANNING AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE OF OILOPEC faces an uncertain future. With major producers relying on oil to balance their state budgets, the temptation may well be to supply as much as possible to maximize incoming cashflows; considering there are an estimated 6 million barrels a day of oil production currently offline in nations around the world. While this production is unlikely to come back online quickly, the race to supply could well spell an end to comprehensive OPEC cooperation, and undermine the cohesion and influence of the organization going forward.Demand growth for oil is undoubtedly going to slow in 2020, with a likely outright year-on-year decline.The global disruption from coronavirus COVID-19 looks likely to frame the landscape for months to come.While this will present a turbulent period for some industry players, the fundamental demand for oil remains unshaken.Is this the end for oil? Certainly not. But it may spell the end for reliable OPEC cooperation in the future and spark a battle for survival for established players most exposed to a period of sustained low oil prices.Dave Sivaprasad is Managing Director and Partner of Boston Consulting Group."},

Saudi Aramco, already the most profitable company across the globe with a US$2 trillion market valuation, has just announced a US$88.2 billion profit in 2019.This figure might have missed estimates but suggests the company is cash-rich and can hold out well in an oil price war.This strategy to flood oil markets may be a high-stakes gamble that could turn out to be the masterstroke that also gives the kingdom a stronger hand in oil markets and forces Russia back to the OPEC+ negotiating table.RAMPING UP INTERNATIONAL ACTIONAmid these uncertainties, Saudi Arabia knows the only way to put the dampeners on the COVID-19 spread is through international cooperation.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nG20 held a two-day meeting from Feb 21 to 22, 2020,\u00a0in the capital of Saudi Arabia, the first Arab nation to hold the grouping's presidency.

In fact, it was the availability of this cheap credit that fuelled the housing bubble in the US.When the crisis broke, governments around the world turned to monetary policy, fiscal stimulus and corporate bail-outs to contain the recession.Central banks kept cutting the already low interest rates in a bid to first, rescue their economy and, then, boost it.As a result, we now live in an era of even lower interest rates.\u00a0 In developed economies, interest rates are less than 2 per cent.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe ECB is one of the central banks that has kept interest rates at a record low in a bid to boost the economy. AFP/DANIEL ROLAND\n                            \n\n                    \n                In some countries, we now have negative interest rates as governments are looking at ways to get people to spend to boost their economies and save less. Sweden was the first to do this post-crisis.\u00a0 Denmark and Switzerland too have interest-rate measures to boost spending and reduce savings.\u00a0 The UK is now also in negative rates territory.PRIVATE BORROWING GREWThe low rates have allowed businesses to borrow cheaply, pushing debt up.Which is why much of the shoulder-breaking debt burden we see now is caused by private borrowing.Comparing against the crisis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) explained that in advanced economies the corporate debt ratio has gradually increased since the beginning of this decade and is now at the same level as 2008 - the previous time it peaked.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Big Tech is showing some love to the US government \u2013 which comes as no surpriseThe US and China are the biggest culprits of this private debt accumulation, according to the IMF. The US saw its corporate debt grow consistently since 2011 to hit record high levels at the end of 2018. China, on the other hand, has seen its corporate debt increase compared to other emerging markets.THE END OF MONETARY POLICYSo why don\u2019t central banks simply increase interest rates to avoid falling into a potentially risky situation? After all, if they make borrowing more expensive then private debt should fall.It is not so simple. The low rates of interest have blunted governments\u2019 abilities to stimulate economic growth. Since interest rates are near zero or, in some cases, negative, they cannot slash it any further to boost spending.This has made monetary policy ineffective and perhaps even redundant. In the absence of monetary action, governments are left with fiscal stimulus to grow their economies.That is why throughout this decade, as interest-rates remained low and could not do anymore to stimulate the economy, governments spent instead, pushing up public debt.GOVERNMENTS HAD TO SPENDThe IIF estimates that by the end of the year, global government debt will top US$70 trillion in 2019, higher than the US$65.7 trillion in 2018.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nFalling exports and capital investment have put a dent in the South Korean economy despite increased government and consumer spending AFP/Ed Jones\n                            \n\n                    \n                The problem with relying mostly on fiscal policy is that governments have to balance what they spend in terms of revenue. But many of the advanced economies were dealing with record levels of unemployment in the aftermath of the crisis, so revenue sources such as income tax and indirect taxes were low.This is why governments had to borrow to fund their stimulus spending over the decade. The IMF stated that the public debt ratios in 90 per cent of advanced economies are higher than before 2008.\u00a0It is no wonder that, according to the IMF, in 2018 half of the advanced economies put an end to this unsustainable spending to run fiscal surpluses whereas a third reduced their fiscal deficit or increased their fiscal surplus compared with the previous year.NO ROOM TO GROWAs governments incurred consistent budgetary deficits (high spending and low revenue), it was unsustainable for them to borrow to finance their spending to stimulate the economy.Which likely explains why the 2010 to 2019 decade is the longest economic recovery period ever seen.\u00a0READ:\u00a0Commentary: To measure inequality, we need internationally recognised methods and indicatorsThe challenge for governments in the next decade though is more complex than ever.On the one hand, they cannot lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth. But there is also a limit to how much fiscal stimulus governments can use to spur the economy as they have budget deficits and public debt limitations to worry about.Raising interest rates to attract foreign capital into the economy is also difficult as it could further dampen economic growth by giving a boost to savings and reducing consumer spending.But a high global debt situation in a low growth, low interest rates economy is also very risky. At least in 2008 when trouble hit, governments could slash interest rates and spend to save their economies.What tools could government effectively use to fight the next fire?Malminderjit Singh is editor at CNA Digital News, Commentary section."},

Tehran sought to look tough but not too threatening to invite a US reprisal.But the targeted killing of a celebrated Iranian commander is a game changer, meaning the Iranian response will likely be stronger.Given the perils of direct confrontation for the Iranian regime, the most likely recourse may be a mobilisation of Iran\u2019s proxy affiliations to exact revenge on the United States, most likely in Iraq.In fact, Iran does not really need to instruct Shia militia in Iraq to hurt the United States. The Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU) also lost its second-in-command (Abu Mahdi al Muhandis) in the same drone attack that killed Soleimani.Rocket attacks in recent days on the Green Zone in Baghdad are likely to be just the prelude to a major PMU action against US assets in Iraq.READ:\u00a0Iran's strikes on US bases in Iraq 'calibrated not to cause casualties': ExpertThe turning tide against the US military presence, evident in the Iraqi parliament\u2019s resolution to expel foreign forces, could embolden PMU to step up its operations even further.This would be disastrous for the war-ravaged country, and there is no guarantee that Iran would not be embroiled in the conflict.RESUME NUCLEAR PROGRAMME?Beyond the military options, Iran also has two immediate diplomatic options.

He later apologised for implicitly casting Israeli Arabs as fifth columnists. But it did the job.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementAT IT AGAIN?Some observers think he is at it again, as he bids for a record fifth term as prime minister, with the shadow of indictment for corruption hanging over him, and facing an even tougher contest in the general election from a centre-right alliance led by Benny Gantz, a former army chief of staff.On Saturday (Apr 6), Mr Netanyahu pledged to annex huge swaths of the occupied West Bank on which the Palestinians still hope to build an independent state alongside Israel.He said Israel would take not just the big clusters of Jewish settlements, mostly around Jerusalem, but also the settler outposts deep inside the West Bank.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\u201cI will impose sovereignty, but I will not distinguish between settlement blocs and isolated settlements,\u201d Mr Netanyahu told Israel\u2019s Channel 12 News. \u201cI will not uproot anyone (among the Jewish settlers), and I will not transfer sovereignty to the Palestinians.\u201dSome argue this is just rhetoric fashioned for election eve by a canny politician who is ready to say anything but is fundamentally risk-averse.

Last year the central committee of his rightwing Likud party \u2014 whose charter expressly repudiates a Palestinian state \u2014 voted unanimously to extend Israeli sovereignty and law to \u201call liberated areas of Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank)\u201d.If the polls are right, Mr Gantz\u2019s coalition will narrowly beat Likud, but Mr Netanyahu will still have the better chance of forming another coalition \u2014 stretching even further to the far-right, and taking in groups that advocate the \u201ctransfer\u201d of Palestinians to neighbouring Arab countries.That alone makes it unlikely that the prime minister will tone things down.\u00a0Even in his outgoing government, his education minister Naftali Bennett was demanding annexation, while his justice minister, Ayelet Shaked, wants to draw the teeth of Israel\u2019s high courts and extend Israeli law into the West Bank \u2014 de facto annexation and a two-pronged assault on the rule of law.But the really fundamental change has been wrought by President Donald Trump, who has ripped up decades of US policy and international law on the Middle East.Last year, Mr Trump recognised Jerusalem \u2014 including the Israeli-occupied Arab east of the holy city annexed after the Six day war in 1967 \u2014 as Israel\u2019s capital and moved the US embassy there.READ: Trump's recognition of Jerusalem upends years of necessary shadow play, a commentary\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA Palestinian protestor steps on a poster of US President Donald Trump following his decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, in Gaza City, on Dec 7, 2017.

There is, however, an underlying point lurking here.Mr Trump\u2019s endorsements of annexation, aside from delighting the West\u2019s adversaries from Russia to China, are a gift to Mr Netanyahu\u2019s irredentist rivals, such as Mr Bennett and Ms Shaked. They would put an eventual US imprimatur on something between applying Israeli law in most of the West Bank (the Golan model) or outright annexation (the Jerusalem model).He has opened a path for Israel\u2019s ultra-right to annex the West Bank, now home to almost 650,000 Jewish settlers, including the 200,000 in occupied Arab East Jerusalem, among close to 3 million Palestinians.That would end any lingering hopes of an independent Palestinian state, and condemn future generations of Israeli Jews to the instability of living in a single state with Palestinian Arabs as second-class citizens \u2014 who would eventually outnumber them in the cramped and combustible space between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nPalestinian protestors clash with Israeli forces near an Israeli checkpoint in the West Bank town of Bethlehem on Dec 9, 2017.

The annexation genie is out of the bottle.This story, seen by Arabs as the colonisation of the Palestinians by Israel, is reaching the point of no return."},

The American relationship is hotly debated, as the US is often blamed for supporting some leaders in pre-democratic South Korea.And there is sneaking suspicion that the US military presence here manipulates South Korean foreign policy, a neo-colonial critique one frequently sees in South Korean movies.A LOT OF FUSS ABOUT JAPANRegarding Japan, the left here is downright ideological. Rather than grudgingly cooperate over shared North Korean concerns, Moon\u2019s coalition wants a confrontation with Japan over historical issues.Ideally d\u00e9tente with North Korea would improve the South\u2019s position too.Both Koreas cooperating would more effectively pressure Tokyo over the war, and South Korea would not need Japanese assistance on intelligence gathering or anything else if intra-Korean peace were at hand.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Whose idea was it to mix North Korea diplomacy and football?\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nSouth Korea's President Moon Jae-in.

First, the rule of onen man until 1987 obviously constrained these preferences.Since then, the popularity of the US alliance, combined with US hostility to this foreign policy programme, has constrained Seoul.Moon is the first South Korean president to really push this re-orientation. He is South Korea\u2019s third liberal president, but his two predecessors from 1998 to 2008 never went as far as Moon has.PUSHED HARDER THAN ANY PREVIOUS PRESIDENTAs an experiment, it has been fascinating to watch. Moon has pushed for a North Korean breakthrough far harder than any previous South Korean president.He has met the North Korean leader more than all other South Korean presidents combined.He has spoken so favourably of Kim Jong Un, North Korea\u2019s supreme leader, that Moon has been criticised for grovelling and acting as North Korea\u2019s foreign minister.Moon has also gambled on this d\u00e9tente effort to draw a much tougher line on Japan than his predecessors.He unilaterally withdrew South Korea from a pact it signed with Japan to resolve the \u201ccomfort women\u201d issue, deeply alienating Tokyo and Washington and provoking debates about South Korean credibility.When Japan hit back with trade restrictions, Moon doubled down on ideology in language, which shocked almost everyone outside of the leftist milieu in South Korea.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nSouth Korea's President Moon Jae-in in happier times with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

But Japan finds the pact valuable.READ:\u00a0Commentary: The uncomfortable North Korea wedge between Japan and South KoreaCommentary: Japan PM Shinzo Abe has an unfinished political legacyCuriously, Moon\u2019s own government even admitted that value by using GSOMIA sharing several times in the months after Moon declared South Korea\u2019s intention to leave.At the same time, Moon openly resisted US President Donald Trump\u2019s demand for a much higher South Korean contribution to joint defence through the \u201cSpecial Measures Agreement\u201d (SMA), which governs ROK\u2013US burden-sharing.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in visit an observation post in the Joint Security Area at Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating North and South Korea on Jun 30, 2019.

It is not clear at the moment if the Moon government will do the same.A MINI REVOLUTIONIn short, Moon has pushed a mini-revolution in ROK foreign policy. He has aggressively sought a breakthrough with the North, weathering conspiracy theories and accusations of appeasement to do so.Banking on that, Moon has taken a hard line on both Japan over GSOMIA and the US over SMA in the last few months.This is a pretty heady, pretty risky mix. It leans heavily on an inter-Korean breakthrough to offset tougher relations with traditional allies who share South Korea\u2019s values \u2013 democracy, pluralism, liberalism, markets.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Right now, it must feel good to be Kim Jong UnRelying on North Korea for anything is, of course, a gamble, and North Korea has, indeed, been unreliable throughout the recent d\u00e9tente.

Never threaten the United States again,\" Trump said in a tweet.AN ESCALATING EXCHANGEWhile details behind the attack on the tankers are still murky, both Washington and Tehran have attributed the attacks to the other party.An initial assessment by US intelligence has blamed Iran for the sabotage, while Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi has hinted at \u201cplots by ill-wishers to disrupt regional security\u201d, implying that the attacks were initiated by the US or its allies as a pretext for military engagement.\n    AdvertisementViewed through the lens of their simmering conflict, the attacks can only heighten the growing distrust between the US and Iran, as each sees the attacks as an act of aggression from the other side.Worse, the strategic value of the Persian Gulf may also lead to both Washington and Tehran viewing the attacks as a threat to their regional security interests.Control of these vital waters is not only crucial for Iran\u2019s national security by serving as a buffer zone against regional rivals, the Gulf is also a key energy supply route that can significantly affect the economy and energy security of the US.Already perceiving the other party as responsible for the attacks, should the US or Iran feel that this incident tangibly threaten the security of themselves and their allies, hawks on either side could use this incident to justify a military confrontation.AMERICA\u2019S TOUGHER STANCE AGAINST IRANAmerica\u2019s move towards a tougher stance against Iran has been praised and encouraged by its Middle Eastern allies \u2013 Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2013 who are at geopolitical loggerheads with Tehran.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe US has sent a naval strike group to the region amid heightened tensions with Iran (Photo: AFP/Darion Chanelle Triplett)\n                            \n\n                    \n                READ:\u00a0Iran nuclear deal likely to see gradual demise, a commentaryWith relations having cooled under the Obama administration owing to the compromises the US president made to bring about peace with Iran, Trump\u2019s correction of his Iran policy has been perceived by Israel and Saudi Arabia as a renewal of the US\u2019s commitment to defending their respective regional security interests.Encouragement from hawkish Tel Aviv and Riyadh may strengthen US resolve to use economic pressure and military force against Tehran.This grim scenario is a stark contrast to the \u201cgood feeling\u201d between both countries in 2015 when the Obama Administration negotiated a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran. Requiring Tehran to set back its nuclear weapons programme by ten years in return for relief from US sanctions, the deal aimed not only to reduce nuclear proliferation in the Middle East but also to pave the way for future reconciliation between both countries.While the agreement was in many ways imperfect and the possibility of reconciliation uncertain, it did succeed in achieving its short-run objective of retarding Iran\u2019s nuclear development, as IAEA confirmed that Tehran had been keeping to its obligations under the deal.President Trump, however, has taken a very different approach to relations with Iran. In contrast to Obama\u2019s more conciliatory attitude towards Tehran, his administration has adopted a markedly more antagonistic stance towards the Islamic Republic, continuing to view it as a threat despite its continued compliance with the Nuclear Deal. \u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS President Donald Trump has threatened further sanctions unless Iran \"fundamentally alters its conduct\".

Rapid technological developments and disruptive innovation have created new means for terrorists, criminals and dissenters to harm our well-being.Several threats we face today cannot be neutralised, unlike the threat of total, all-out war by a conventional enemy, where traditional strategies of deterrence and retaliation with overwhelming force can be employed. Instead they should be thought of as security risks that can only be mitigated.All these have the common aim of bringing a country to its knees by creating fear, disrupting moving parts that are essential for a well-functioning society.\n    AdvertisementHOW THE TARGETTING OF CIVILIAN LIVES HAS CHANGEDOne such security risk that targets innocent civilian lives is terrorism, particularly the new version of terrorism manifested by the Islamic State (IS) terrorist network that had captured lands in Syria and Iraq around 2014.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Will killing Islamic State leader Baghdadi give Trump a boost in the polls?READ:\u00a0Commentary: Islamic State chief Baghdadi\u2019s death exposes its vulnerabilitiesThe group has utilised a blend of low- and high- technologies to generate simple but widespread attacks that will likely become a model for future terrorist groups to emulate.The IS recognised that security agencies around the world have learned to adapt to the large-scale terrorist attacks carried out by Al Qaeda over the course of the 2000s - many of which required a significant amount of planning, financial resourcing and training of trusted operatives as demonstrated by the 9/11 attacks.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\u00a0Fighters of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist network that had\u00a0captured lands in Syria and Iraq since\u00a02014\n                            \n\n                    \n                Instead, leveraging on the social pervasiveness of digital media to recruit as many followers as possible, the IS has moved to a more decentralised system of terrorist attacks by indoctrinating citizens in target countries all over the world, and advocating the use of easy-to-carry-out knife attacks and vehicular ramming of citizens to create public fear and anxiety.Comprehensive crib sheets on how to carry out such attacks are circulated online. These attacks themselves require literally no concrete planning, financial resourcing, or training\u2014signatures that intelligence agencies try to pick up to detect an impending assault.To date, IS\u2019 new small-scale model of threats have produced over 50 knife attacks and nearly 30 vehicle ramming operations across the world. In comparison, major attacks attributed to al-Qaeda in the 2000s amount to about 20 incidents.READ:\u00a0Commentary: The secret group dynamics that fuel horrifying terror attacksREAD:\u00a0Commentary: Why the London Bridge attacker walked free - while serving terrorism offencesThe 9/11 attacks alone resulted in about 3,000 deaths, over 25,000 injuries, and caused at least US$10 billion in infrastructural damage. Terrorist groups are moving towards a strategy of a larger quantity of smaller attacks over a few big hits.A NEW TOOL: CHEAP, EASILY OPERATED DRONESAnother security risk is the proliferation of commercial off-the-shelf technology such as drones.These aerial vehicles, which have flooded the market, have been used by terrorist groups such as the IS, criminals, and other bad actors to attack or harass people and are difficult to detect.Since 2016, the IS has been using modified quadcopter drones drop small bombs onto human targets in the Middle East.READ:\u00a0Commentary: We are woefully ill-equipped to deal with rogue dronesREAD:\u00a0Commentary: Desperate Iran\u2019s dangerous game of brinksmanship in the GulfIn September this year, British police seized a modified drone seized from an IS supporter's home that was intended to be used in an attack against a military installation in the country.

In June this year, unauthorised drones caused flight delays and disruptions at Changi Airport.Going forward, the greatest danger posed by drones flying near airports is the possibility of mid-air collisions with aircraft, which would be catastrophic and erode trust in commercial air travel.Such disruptions not only stoke fear, they also intend to disrupt commercial activities and fracture business sentiments in the country.WHY DIGITAL IS THE NEW BATTLEGROUNDWith the advent of digital technology, and as countries become increasingly reliant on the flow of digital data and service to power their economies, this area can also be a new vulnerability. \u00a0READ:\u00a0Commentary: Islamic State militant group ran an info war \u2018like a viral marketing campaign\u2019This decade was marked by the rise of by cyber-crimes, computer attacks, and online influence operations, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), against governments, corporations and individuals.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nAustralian intelligence determined China was responsible for a cyber-attack on its national parliament and three largest political parties before the general election in May.

In addition to reducing vulnerabilities, investments must be made in risk and crisis management to blunt the impact of security incidents and other mishaps.Second, agencies will also have to expand their capabilities in the detection, monitoring and pre-emption of such threats as their traditional methods and channels become inadequate.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA self-driving vehicle and surveillance drone on display at the launch of the Security Industry Digital Plan in Singapore.\u00a0(Photo: Fann Sim)\n                            \n\n                    \n                On the technological front, surveillance radars, for instance, must be geared to detect small drones and not just aircrafts or missiles.\u00a0On the human front, intelligence agencies must see how they can intercept knowledge of small-scale and \u201clone-wolf\u201d attacks.Third, laws must be updated to create the appropriate instruments and deterrents to deal with such threats.In addition, deeply embedded within a risk-ready society is resilience.Singapore has made significant investments to future-proof its people through efforts like the Total Defence initiative established in 1984.The notion of psychological defence as one of now six pillars (\u201cdeveloping resilience and the strength to return to our normal activities as soon as possible after a crisis hits\u201d) remind us that citizens must prevail over whatever newfound risks confront us as we venture forward.Indeed, for all the new strategies, laws and technologies put in place to ensure Singapore remains safe and secure, what underpins security is the strength of a united people that think critically and respond to new threats decisively.That key ingredient will remain essential in Singapore\u2019s bid to combat these new security threats not only for the next decade but many more after.Graham Ong-Webb is adjunct fellow at the S.

For COVID-19, 23 vaccines are on human trial. These include inactivated vaccines which are made using particles of the virus that were killed so that they would not be able to infect or replicate in those injected with it.\u00a0\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementThe doses are also meant to help the body create antibodies against the dead virus. The private Chinese company Sinovac Biotech is among those pursuing this type of vaccine.\u00a0A new class of vaccine that uses genetic material in the form of ribonucleic acid (RNA) is also being explored, particularly by American company Moderna. The vaccine uses messenger RNA to produce viral proteins that mimic the outer surface of the coronavirus.\u00a0The body recognises these virus-like proteins as foreign invaders and can then mount an immune response against the actual virus. Moderna announced promising results on Jul 14 and said it would enter the final stage of human trials on Jul 27.WHAT HAPPENS IN EACH PHASE OF CLINICAL TRIAL? \n    AdvertisementProducing a vaccine is a process that involves multiple stages. These include pre-clinical tests which sometimes involve testing on animals to determine if the vaccine produces a desired immune response.Next comes Phase 1, which is when scientists assess the initial safety of the drug in a relatively small number of people.Phase 2 judges the vaccine\u2019s efficacy on the virus. Scientists would give the vaccine to a bigger group of people, usually in their hundreds and split into groups, to see if the vaccine acts differently in them. This stage is also used to further test the safety of the trial vaccine.In Phase 3, the vaccine is introduced to thousands of participants and their blood is compared against to those who receive a placebo.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nHealth workers assist a COVID-19 patient at the Gilberto Novaes Municipal Hospital in Manaus, Brazil.

China\u2019s state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission\u00a0said a Chinese-made vaccine could be ready as early as the end of this year.The World Health Organization meanwhile said in June that a few hundred million COVID-19 vaccine doses could be produced by the end of the year -\u00a0and be targeted at those most vulnerable to the virus.\"If we're very lucky, there will be one or two successful candidates before the end of this year,\" WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a virtual press conference.READ:\u00a0WHO eyes hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses before 2021Currently, several potential vaccines are in Phase 3 of development. A vaccine being developed by the British-Swedish company AstraZeneca and Oxford University is among them.\u00a0Data released on Jul 20 showed it induced an immune response in all study participants who received two doses without any serious side effects. Reports suggest emergency vaccines may be delivered by October.\u00a0CanSinoBiologics from China and the country's military research unit have also produced promising results. Researchers said their trial vaccine showed it appears to be safe and induced an immune response in most of the 508 healthy volunteers who got one dose of the vaccine.About\u00a077 per cent of study volunteers experienced side effects like fever or injection site pain, but none considered to be serious.READ:\u00a0Wave of promising study results raise hopes for COVID-19 vaccines\u00a0Vaccines usually take a number of years if not decades to produce -\u00a0because several rounds of testing are required before they can be approved for use on humans. Given the enormity of the current health crisis, scientists are racing against time to try to produce a vaccine in a matter of months.They will however have to prove they are safe and effective in trials involving thousands of subjects before final approval is given for their use. Given the amount of time and resources required, it comes as no surprise that developing vaccines is a costly affair.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nMedical workers work at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients at St. Marianna Medical University Hospital in Kawasaki, south of Tokyo, Japan May 4, 2020.

Here is\u00a0a\u00a0look at how long it took to develop vaccines for some infectious diseases.CHICKEN POX: Also known as primary varicella infection, it was only distinguished from herpes zoster (shingles) in the 1950s, and the first vaccine was developed in Japan in the 1970s.YELLOW FEVER: This disease has plagued humans for more than 500 years, and a vaccine was finally created in 1937 by Nobel laureate Max Theiler, which is used to this day.INFLUENZA: During the 1918 influenza pandemic, there were no known cures for the virus, and the first vaccine appeared only in 1945.\u00a0Just two years later, however, researchers concluded that seasonal changes in the composition of the virus meant existing vaccines became ineffective. They discovered that two main types of influenza viruses occur, along with multiple new strains, each year. For this reason, scientists have had to tweak the vaccines every year.SARS: The virus first infected humans in China\u2019s Guangdong province in 2002 and was identified in 2003 as an animal virus from possibly bats, before spreading to other animals and then humans.\u00a0Two SARS vaccines were evaluated in humans, said Professor Kanta Subbarao from the University of Melbourne.\u201cA number of promising candidates were tested in pre-clinical studies, but they weren't pursued because SARS didn't re-emerge,\" she said.BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the coronavirus outbreak and its developmentsDownload\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegram"},

This makes the Bank of England\u2019s assumption of a smooth economic rebound more implausible.It will also complicate the withdrawal or modification of government support programmes. A further implication is that the effects on different groups will remain unequal.Yet another is that government and business will have to find ways to reassure workers and customers.READ: Commentary: The world economy is now collapsingLISTEN: COVID-19 and the outlook for Singapore\u2019s residential property market in 2020 and beyondThe close links among different groups of workers will be particularly hard to manage.

Of course, Germany\u2019s policy response eventually produced hyperinflation, and much more profound social disintegration thereafter.WHO WILL PICK UP THE TAB?Policymakers today will face a similar temptation to extend the emergency and defer the eventual reckoning and distribution of costs.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Can countries sue China for COVID-19?

No way.Wei\u2019s approximately 30-minute speech was laced with fiery rhetoric, though he took pains to underscore China\u2019s defensive posture as he touched on how China would exercise restraint but would retaliate if provoked, be it attempts at splitting Taiwan from the mainland, or aggressive posturing in the South China Sea.The problem \u2026 is that in recent years some countries outside the region come to the South China Sea to flex muscles in the name of freedom of navigation.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementHe added: \u201cThe large-scale force projection and offensive operations in the region are the most serious, destabilising and uncertain factors in the South China Sea.\u201dAlthough he did not mention any country by name, it seemed clear he was referring to the US which has conducted four freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) through the South China Sea this year so far, in which US naval vessels exercise internationally recognised rights to passage in those waters.READ:\u00a0The US, China, a security dilemma and a way out in Singapore, a commentary\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nChinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe speaks at the IISS Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, June 2, 2019.

But it can ill afford to appear ceding territory or looking weak.READ:\u00a0\u00a0China\u2019s chief conundrum - how to look after the world\u2019s fastest ageing population, a commentaryBeijing also understands that as it grows in power, the status quo in the South China Sea may gradually shift in its favour.Inasmuch as Wei\u2019s fiery rhetoric might have been designed for domestic public consumption, it was revealing when asked about how China reconciles its statement that it will not seize land from others with its building of features on islands in the South China Sea, that he responded that building limited defence facilities was \u201ctotally legitimate\u201d because \u201cChina\u2019s islands and reefs in the South China Sea are part of the Chinese territory\u201d.To desist from what has been long regarded as legitimate rights exercised \u201con its own territory\u201d,\u00a0he pointed out, would undermine the ruling Communist Party\u2019s legitimacy back home.So while the US might exercise continued presence in the South China Sea, the fact is regional countries and other claimant states might be losing ground.SILVER LINING ON THE HORIZON?Both China and the US have taken great pains to avoid conflict in the South China Sea in the immediate term.

How do we work together? The intent is to avoid a misunderstanding, avoid miscalculation.There are existing confidence-building mechanisms in place, notably, the 1998 Agreement on Establishing a Consultation Mechanism to Strengthen Military Maritime Safety, the 2014 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding the Rules of Behaviour for Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters and a 2015 Supplement to the 2014 MOU outlining more detailed rules of engagement for air-to-air encounters.Here, both Shanahan and Wei are certainly correct when they said that risk reduction strategies including military-to-military communications channels that remain open are critical to avoid an escalation of any incidents on the ground \u2013 even if those are fraught with challenges at times.MORAL SUASION?Amidst these simmering bilateral tensions, what should offer some hope are multilateral platforms where countries can shape norms of acceptable behaviour for the long term, regardless of the outcome of the territory disputes in the South China Sea.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe US Navy guided missile destroyer USS William P\u00a0Lawrence.

We can also expect China\u2019s continued build-up of those islands and modernisation of its navy and coastguard while assiduously seeking not to cross the threshold of an armed confrontation.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nRisks of chance encounters between\u00a0military aircraft spiralling out of control have risen in recent years as Beijing becomes ever more assertive in the South China Sea (Photo: AFP/Handout)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Tensions will continue to roil the disputed waters, but as Southeast Asian countries too hope to focus on economic growth and preserving a regional environment that allows for this, parties concerned will likely refrain from escalation.A huge dose of unilateral self-restraint by all actors will be needed until a CoC that can provide an agreed approach on how countries with territorial claims can find a peaceful resolution to the dispute comes to fruition.At the same time, as the CoC process continues, it may be worthwhile to seriously consider a commonly accepted definition of \u201cmilitarisation\u201d and what other actions should not be taken by claimant states, since it has remained a sticking point in this Shangri-La Dialogue.Koh Swee Lean Collin is research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, a constituent unit of the S.

The perception that inequalities are reaching unjustifiable heights in many countries, combined with a lack of any possible informed choice for voters, is fodder for demagogues and critics of democracy.READ: Commentary: Why having access to your Google and Facebook data can be life-changing\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementMaking matters worse, experts in the field of inequality are sometimes depicted as being overly reliant on specific methodological approaches, as illustrated in The Economist\u2019s recent cover story, Inequality illusions.But, of course, data in the social sciences are by their very nature open to challenge, which makes methodological debates largely unavoidable. The question is where to draw the line between legitimate academic disagreement about inequality levels and trends and outright inequality denialism.HOW ACCEPTABLE IS INEQUALITY?Whether or not inequality is acceptable \u2013 and whether or not something should be done about it \u2013 is a matter of collective choice. To help inform the debate, more than 100 researchers from around the world have joined forces to develop innovative methods for compiling inequality statistics through the World Inequality Database (WID), which now covers more than 100 countries.\n    AdvertisementThe WID includes the widest possible array of available data sources, from household surveys, tax-administration data, national accounts, and wealth rankings published in the media, to the \u201cPanama Papers\u201d, through which the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists exposed stockpiles of wealth stashed in various tax havens.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nIn April 2016, media outlets published details of murky offshore financial dealings gleaned from 11.5 million leaked documents from a Panamanian law firm \u2013 the so-called \"Panama Papers\".

When consistently applied to various regions and countries, divergent patterns appear, with inequality increasing in some countries, and stagnating or declining in (a few) others.And the WID is just one of multiple institutions \u2013 including the Commitment to Equity Institute, the World Bank and the OECD \u2013 now fruitfully working to improve our understanding of these issues.WHY IT IS HARDER TO MEASURE INEQUALITYBut progress in measuring inequality has been hampered by recent policy developments, which belie narratives about greater transparency. Many advanced economies have reduced the number of tax audits performed each year, making it harder to access and analyse this key source of information.Likewise, as progressive taxes on capital incomes have been phased out, and as wealth and inheritance taxes have been repealed, some of the most basic sources of data on wealth inequality have disappeared.READ: Commentary: MNCs have gotten away with paying less taxes. That must changeREAD: Commentary: Want to fight inequality? How about paying higher taxes first? Owing to the lack of high-quality fiscal and administrative data on capital incomes and wealth, many observers will turn to other sources, such as billionaire rankings published by a number of magazines.But while these sources can provide valuable insights, they do not meet the standards of methodological rigoiur and conceptual clarity on which an informed public conversation should be based.MOVING TOWARDS A STANDARD SET OF INDICATORSFor these reasons, researchers, the media, and civil-society organisations need to get more involved. It is critical that we develop an internationally recognised set of indicators and methods for tracking income and wealth.Government statistical agencies should be publishing the income and wealth levels of the top 1 per cent, 0.1 per cent, and 0.001 per cent, as well as the effective taxes paid by these groups.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of the United Nations is seen on the outside of their headquarters in New York, September 15, 2013.

It would be a pity to wait for the centennial of GDP \u2013 or for another recession \u2013 to craft distributional growth statistics.All societies must start to engage more in the production and dissemination of transparent economic information.

First, they must increase their rates of innovation in order to compete better against fast-growing emerging economies.That will require them to develop policies that strengthen national systems of innovation, education, and training, and improve the governance and financing of their firms.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Can the RCEP save the Singapore economy?READ: Commentary: Why aren\u2019t there more Singaporean CEOs?Municipal- and regional-level policies should support these goals.Second, the West needs to understand that there is a global ladder of economic development, the rungs of which represent increasing levels of organisational and technological complexity, and value added per capita.It is difficult for any firm to gain a competitive advantage in activities such as manufacturing cheap clothes and assembling electronic components, resulting in low value added per capita, and thus low wages and salaries.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nEmployees work on a production line manufacturing camera lenses for cellphones at a factory in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, China April 30, 2019.

The latter therefore must innovate rapidly both to increase the value added of their current industries, and to move into new high-value-added sectors.RACE TO THE TOP, NOT BOTTOMFinally, Western firms and policymakers should understand that their countries\u2019 competition with China and other rising economic powers is now a \u201crace to the top,\u201d not a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d in which cheap labour and a \u201cfavourable\u201d exchange rate are seen as the best ways to achieve and maintain competitiveness.If developed countries can move further up the ladder of economic development by innovating and creating new high-value-added products and services while ceding lower value-added areas of activity to developing countries, then all can increase their national standards of living at the same time.If the pie is larger, everyone can have a larger slice.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Shocks lined a rather demanding year for Singapore and the global economy\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nA woman walks past an electronic board showing the stock market indices of various countries outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan on\u00a0Oct\u00a011, 2018.

Over the past 12 months, there have been repeated promises \u2013 and cancellations \u2013 made by all sides. It certainly remains to be seen whether the three countries will meet as suggested \u2013 and whether it will amount to any more than \u201cgesture politics\u201d if they do.On one level, things do look different from\u00a0the past, when little tangible progress was made.

It will be a long process.NUCLEAR PROGRAMME A BARGAINING CHIPAlthough Kim Jong Un\u2019s current performance on this issue is occasionally more promising than that of his father or grandfather, the truth is that he cannot abandon his nuclear programme until he can see an alternative way of guaranteeing the security of his regime.READ: Kim Jong Un, the modern, strange and brilliant leader of North Korea, a commentaryAfter all, North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme has so far worked well as a bargaining chip in international negotiations \u2013 although the current UN sanctions are an exception.Indeed, North Korea\u2019s nuclear threats and long-range missiles have strengthened the county\u2019s hand against the US, while without them, North Korea has almost nothing to offer as a concession.Nor should we forget the role the North Korean media plays. By showing images of Kim Jong Un shaking hands with world leaders, it has become part of his survival strategy, bolstering his strongman image among both ordinary North Koreans and his government.\u00a0Any meeting Kim Jong Un agrees to should, at least partly, be seen in this light.Ultimately, there have been no significant changes in North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme (besides demolishing some old or disused facilities).

And how can negotiators overcome the current chicken-or-egg dilemma: Denuclearisation first or economic support first? The answer is twofold.\u00a0First, we need something truly imaginative. Perhaps the US can find a solution by transforming the nuclear sites in North Korea into special industrial clusters and providing some of its military capability in exchange for nuclear disarmament. In this way, North Korea can attract private investment from the US, while easing its security concerns.In the end, however, foreign policy objectives on the peninsula will need to be realistic. A\u00a0truly denuclearised North Korea will never happen as it will retain its theoretical nuclear knowledge. It will be far more practical, then, to find common ground of mutual interests.Second, there needs to be a sense of \u201cmutual accountability\u201d. The traditional definition of accountability has three stages: Responsibility, answerability, and enforceability.The \u201cresponsibility\u201d stage can take the form of policy dialogue and trust building. Plenty of dialogue occurred during the six-party talks held intermittently since 2003 between North Korea, China, the US, South Korea, Japan and Russia \u2013 but they appeared to fail to build any meaningful trust.\u00a0The latest rounds of dialogue between the US and the two Koreas will also fall at this hurdle unless they find a novel way forward.Consequently, the dialogue must be based on mutual understanding and openness.\u00a0The rest of the world must understand that North Korea is a fragile state, which cannot overcome the denuclearisation problem on its own \u2013 especially given its vulnerable financial situation.After all, it\u2019s not just the US that doesn\u2019t trust North Korea; North Korea doesn\u2019t trust the US either, especially following the toppling of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Muammar Gaddafi in Libya.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nNorth Korea has repeatedly expressed a commitment to the \"denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\" but the term is open to interpretation on both sides.

The \u201canswerability\u201d stage will require much greater information sharing and transparency.\u00a0The international community is so suspicious of the sincerity of Kim Jong Un\u2019s denuclearisation process because of that country\u2019s poor level of openness and the limited access to solid information from within North Korea.\u00a0Once North Korea opens its borders, there will be simultaneous achievements in terms of both denuclearisation and economic development.READ: North Korea in 2018, a year of turning over a new leaf or worldwide gullibility?

It has a good, large-capacity healthcare system and a sophisticated biotech industry that can produce test kits quickly.\n    AdvertisementThese factors enable the country to carry out 15,000 tests per day, making it second only to China in absolute numbers and third in the world for per person testing.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nA driver gets a coronavirus test at a drive-through clinic at a hospital in Daegu, South Korea, February 27, 2020.

Many patients with mild symptoms, especially younger ones, don\u2019t realise they are ill and infecting others.TRACKING PEOPLEIf these patients can\u2019t be found, testing capacity doesn\u2019t mean much. This is where smart city infrastructure comes in.\u00a0The aim is to work out where known patients have been and test anyone who might have come into contact with them. There are three main ways people are tracked.First, credit and debit cards. South Korea has the highest proportion of cashless transactions in the world. By tracking transactions, it\u2019s possible to draw a card user\u2019s movements on the map.Second, mobile phones can be used for the same purpose. In 2019, South Korea had one of the world\u2019s highest phone ownership rates (there are more phones than people).Phone locations are automatically recorded with complete accuracy because devices are connected to between one and three transceivers at any time. And there are approximately 860,000 4G and 5G transceivers densely covering the whole country.READ:\u00a0Commentary: The perfect storm for a COVID-19 outbreak lies in North KoreaREAD: Commentary: Why Singapore is preparing to tap the brakes to slow COVID-19 spreadCrucially, phone companies require all customers to provide their real names and national registry numbers. This means it\u2019s possible to track nearly everyone by following the location of their phones.Finally, CCTV cameras also enable authorities to identify people who have been in contact with COVID-19 patients. In 2014, South Korean cities had over 8 million CCTV cameras, or one camera per 6.3 people. In 2010, everyone was captured an average of 83.1 times per day and every nine seconds while travelling.These figures are likely to be much higher today. Considering the physical size of the country, it is safe to say South Korea has one of the highest densities of surveillance technology in the world.USING THE DATAThe combination of these three technologies means two things.First, health authorities can find out who an infected person has had close contact with after infection. There are dead spots without CCTV or mobile phone signal in public buildings, but not that many. Nearly all potential patients can be found and tested this way.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nSouth Korean soldiers in protective gear make their way while they disinfect buildings downtown, following the rise in confirmed cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Daegu, South Korea, March 15, 2020.

That comparison reveals exactly where, when and from whom the new patient was infected.\u00a0If they can\u2019t be connected to a known earlier patient, that means unknown patients exist, and they can then be identified using the method outlined above.The number of unknown patients at any time serves as an indicator of whether the virus is still spreading and more cases will occur in coming days, or whether the situation has been brought under control.The result of the tracking is not only used by health authorities but also made public via national and local government websites, free smartphone apps that show the locations of infections, and text message updates about new local cases. This help citizens avoid hotspots of infections.In many ways, this is an overexposure of private information about people\u2019s movements. But it is an effective way for the authorities to gain public trust, which in turn is important in preventing people from panicking.READ: Commentary: Fighting fear is key part in battling COVID-19READ: Commentary: Singaporeans queued for toilet paper and instant noodles \u2013 there is no shame in thatYou could argue this was successful because South Korea is one of the few countries where the COVID-19 outbreak hasn\u2019t caused panic buying in supermarkets.However, there\u2019s a big issue for other countries considering similar measures. The level of surveillance and exposure of personal information involved may be hard for some societies to stomach.One thing is certain. The difference between the South Korean approach and that of European countries doesn\u2019t represent the simple cliche of eastern collectivism versus western individualism. In fact, information exposure can prevent the need for a lockdown of individuals\u2019 movements.In this way, governments around the world are facing a hard choice between these two violations of individual rights (information exposure and movement restriction). South Korea has chosen the former, but France and Italy had to choose the latter.\u00a0The former requires the necessary infrastructure and a culture that tolerates a certain level of surveillance, neither of which can be created overnight.BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the novel coronavirus and its developmentsDownload\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegram\u00a0Jung Won Sonn is associate professor at the Bartlett School of Planning, University College London.

Governments have to balance economics with lifesaving public health actions. They don\u2019t always get it right.But key differences remain. For example, the US has long stood out for the fragmentation and market orientation of its healthcare system. Its goal has been efficiency and responsiveness to markets, not pandemic preparedness.In contrast, European countries are opening, but with more testing, attention to healthcare capacity and data.LISTEN:\u00a0COVID-19: Aviation and flying never ever the same againBOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the\u00a0coronavirus outbreak and its developmentsDownload\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegramHolly Jarman is John G Searle Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan.

Washington and Beijing could begin by calling a halt to the war of words.A second step would be to put to one side all their present trade disputes \u2013 suspending punitive tariffs and countermeasures. Mr Trump may need some persuading, but it should not be beyond the wit of his advisers to present such a move as a generous response to the assistance Beijing is now offering other governments.READ:\u00a0Commentary: COVID-19 emphasises the importance of Singapore\u2019s free trade agreementsREAD:\u00a0Commentary: The US healthcare system was ill-prepared in the first placeFor Mr Xi, the simple fact of the quartet would offer testimony to China\u2019s leading role in global governance.

About one in seven cruise ship passengers is over 70, putting them in the highest risk category for COVID-19.After decades of stories about outbreaks of norovirus, the operators already had a poor reputation for keeping them healthy.A COVID-19 case on Carnival\u2019s Diamond Princess is used by epidemiologists to benchmark incubation rates, having resulted in 700 infections and eight deaths.Carnival last week announced it would suspend for two months all sailings under its Princess brand, which accounts for about a fifth of its fleet and targets older holidaymakers wanting longer tours.READ:\u00a0Commentary: COVID-19 may be a mild illness for most peopleREAD:\u00a0Commentary: The ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic could unfoldWhile the action should protect the Princess brand from further damage, it may not help the long-term viability of its product.POSTPONING THE PROBLEMOne certainty is that 2020 is a write-off. Booking cancellations were reported to be running at around 50 per cent even before Italy\u2019s nationwide lockdown and the US\u2019s ban on incoming European travel.Offers of big discounts on future bookings have allowed operators to keep hold of customers\u2019 deposits, delaying any crunch on working capital. But increasingly generous terms and flexibility in the customers\u2019 favour could be storing up cash flow problems for later.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nTugboats assisting the Genting Dream cruise ship on Wednesday (May 2).\u00a0(Photo: Singapore Cruise Society)\n                            \n\n                    \n                US president Donald Trump has talked in vague terms about state assistance. Even if cruise line operators are somehow treated as too big to fail, it is not obvious why they are candidates for bailouts.Carnival\u2019s debt covenants, in common with its main peers, are framed mostly around balance sheet values.Eroding these buffers would take deep writedowns of equity value and significant losses over several years, which does not look very likely, as managements move into cash protection mode. There may well be failures among the smaller, weaker players.But that would make an already cartel-like industry even more concentrated.In 2016 Macquarie estimated a replacement cost for Carnival\u2019s fleet of nearly US$54 billion, more than twice the company\u2019s current shrunken enterprise value of just over US$21 billion.In any assumption other than an L-shaped recovery, the risks of failure are not yet that extreme.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Is the UK\u2019s herd immunity strategy to combat COVID-19 worth pursuing?READ:\u00a0Commentary: Even with near-zero interest rates, a global economic recession is almost certain\u00a0IS THIS GAMBLE WORTH TAKING?So can a valuation argument be built around those facts alone? Potentially \u2014 with the caveat that everyone to try so far has regretted it very soon after. The first quarter has been one that proves the dictum that no matter how bad things are, they can always get worse.For some, however, it looks like a gamble worth taking.

Apart from the initial invasion in 2003 and the eight year war on Iraqi soil that followed, members of the Iraqi parliament expressed anger over a relatively minor sovereignty transgression when Trump visited US troops in the country in December 2018 without bothering to meet the Iraqi Prime Minister.The sense was already there that the US thought it could do what it liked in Iraq.Moreover, the killing of Soleimani comes on top of unilateral US strikes in late December against the pro-Iranian militia Kata\u2019ib Hizballah, in which 25 Iraqi nationals were killed. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi condemned the US attacks.READ:\u00a0Commentary: The 2010s \u2013 when tolerance and pluralism came under attack\n    AdvertisementEven before the assassination of Soleimani, an\u00a0editorial\u00a0in The\u00a0Economist\u00a0magazine of Jan 3 was highly critical of Trump\u2019s violations of Iraqi sovereignty,\u00a0warning they could redound against US interests in Iraq and the broader Middle East.HAVING TROOPS IN IRAQAs well, it is often forgotten (particularly and conveniently by US Republicans) that the reason Barack Obama removed all US military combat personnel from Iraq in December 2011 was not because he abandoned the Iraq mission. Republicans claim that Obama let slip the Bush Administration\u2019s hard-fought victory there after the 2007 \u201csurge\u201d of US troops.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nUS\u00a0President Donald Trump delivers remarks to US\u00a0troops in an unannounced visit to Al Asad Air Base, Iraq Dec\u00a026, 2018.

And an administrative immunity deal won\u2019t count for much if the Iraqi parliament decides that US military personnel who carried out recent military action in Iraq should be prosecuted under Iraqi law.TIT FOR TATAbdul Mahdi was also under enormous pressure from Iran to remove the US presence. But in doing so, he will lose substantial US military and training aid, which has been vital in pushing back and containing Islamic State (IS) since it took over most of western Iraq in 2014.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani walks with Iraq's Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi during a welcome ceremony in Tehran, Iran, April 6, 2019.

(That of course raises the interesting question of whether Russian President Vladimir Putin, ever eager to take advantage of US mistakes in the Middle East, might offer Abdul Mahdi the same assistance.)Moreover, it\u2019s not clear how Iran for all its bluster of revenge over Soleimani will be able to hit back at the US.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Why Soleimani assassination risks all-out war between the US and IranTrump has already said he has 52 targets in Iran lined up for US strikes if Iran retaliates with attacks on US interests anywhere (and he is unlikely to need much in the way of hard evidence before reacting).\u00a0If it comes to tit-for-tat strikes against each other, the US has the capacity to make that sort of thing much harder for Iran than Iran can for the US.\u00a0Even if Iran tries cyber-attacks, where it reportedly has some capability, the US could hit back much more effectively in that area.WILD CARDIran\u2019s leaders will know all this \u2013 and they won\u2019t want to be shown up regionally and before the Iranian people as impotent in the face of US aggression.Another wild card is\u00a0Iran\u2019s announcement overnight that it is withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action signed in 2015 that placed major restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment).\u00a0Trump had already abrogated this unilaterally, but Iran\u2019s formal withdrawal means it can now enrich uranium to nuclear weapon grade.Iran\u2019s leaders would certainly have in mind that the US would have been most unlikely to assassinate\u00a0a major North Korean figure, given Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapon capability.With inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency out of the way, enriching uranium to weapons grade could be done at any of Iran\u2019s existing, well protected underground sites. But anyone who knows Tehran will be aware that a disused factory somewhere in the south Tehran sprawl would also serve for this.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nIran says it will no longer be bound by the number of nuclear enrichment centrifuges it can operate following soaring tensions with the United states (Photo: AFP/HO)\n                            \n\n                    \n                US intelligence might be able to pick up tell-tale electronic evidence of enrichment activity \u2013 though such spooking is not infallible. But if Iran really decides to develop a nuclear weapon in the aftermath of the Soleimani assassination, it\u2019s unlikely that anyone or anything will be able to stop it.The real question will be how long Iran takes to manufacture a nuclear device, and whether it can develop a delivery system, as the North Koreans have.BETTING ON ITBut that\u2019s for the future. For now, all this raises the question of whether Trump might get away with killing Soleimani with no real adverse consequences for him or the US \u2013 indeed with many positive consequences.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Why a US-China \u2018Cool War\u2019 may be worse than a Cold WarIn an\u00a0interview\u00a0with The New Yorker on Jan 4,\u00a0former senior CIA officer and current US congresswoman Elissa Slotkin said that both the Bush and Obama administrations had considered assassinating Soleimani.\u00a0She said it would not have been difficult as Soleimani regularly left himself exposed, as he had at Baghdad airport.\u00a0But discussions had always ended with the conclusion that the adverse consequences from such action would not be worth it.\u00a0She commented that Trump had obviously made a different cost-benefit calculation.That in turn raises the question of whether Trump made any such on-balance decision \u2013 or whether he followed, as he so often does, his gut instinct. It seems highly likely that his action \u2013 carried out now, when he could probably have done this any time over the past three years \u2013 is related to his impeachment.\u00a0And obviously to this year\u2019s presidential election.READ:\u00a0Commentary: US Senate has huge powers and responsibilities in impeachment trialRepublicans, and probably a good many Democrats (if sotto voce), are hugely buoyed by a US military success such as this. And even if the US is kicked out of Iraq, Trump (and most Americans, particularly those in the mid-west states that will decide the election) won\u2019t care.\u00a0The US still has massive intelligence coverage of Iraq and can hit opponents with impunity.Despite the dire prognostications, one can\u2019t rule out that, a few months from now, Trump will be judged by most Americans (and by foreign observers) to have won big by killing Iran\u2019s foremost military commander.Ian Parmeter is a Middle East specialist at ANU's Centre for Arab & Islamic Studies.

It may also be a result of the successful detection of infections in countries which have just ramped up testing.

Like SARS, the vast majority of patients with COVID-19 will experience a mild illness. A small proportion, about one in 8 to 10, will require intensive care, and some may not survive.With SARS, testing only became available weeks after the outbreak began, meaning that many mild cases early on were missed, inflating the fatality rate.The other big difference between SARS and COVID-19, especially in countries previously affected by SARS, is the high degree of healthcare worker protection, which may mean lower rates of infections in medical professionals working on the frontlines.The bad news? There are two possible scenarios we foresee going forward.\u00a0In these,\u00a0it is important to keep in mind that the extent of the global outbreak in the following months will depend on many key factors that can be shaped, including public health responses, the developments in rapid testing, demonstration of effective treatments and potentially the roll-out of a vaccine.READ:\u00a0Commentary: COVID-19 crisis reveals the extraordinary promise of bioengineeringREAD:\u00a0Commentary: On sick leave, but China still makes great leap forward in Med TechIn the first scenario, the epidemic slows down in the northern hemisphere as it starts to warm up. Even now, the countries with high chains of transmission are those where the temperature remains in the 10 to 15 degrees Celsius range and below - South Korea, Italy, Iran and other European countries, as well as the northeast and northwest of the US.While many tropical countries have had some cases, so far, there has not been widespread community transmission so far, perhaps because the higher humidity and warmer weather may be preventing rampant spread.While the virus might disappear altogether in the northern summer like SARS, there is also the risk that, similar to the influenza pandemics of 1918, 1957 and 1968, the COVID-19 outbreak may slow down during the northern hemisphere summer season, but may return in a second wave in October or November when it gets cold again.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nTravelers wear masks in John F Kennedy International Airport in New York, U.S., amid coronavirus reports, March 11, 2020.

For H1N1 in 2009, we know that figure was around a quarter of the population after the first wave of infections.We also know that COVID-19 is more severe than influenza so the impact on healthcare systems, especially in low and middle-income countries can be significant if such\u00a0large proportions\u00a0of the population are infected.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Should you refuse handshakes and hugs amid the COVID-19 outbreak?THREE SCENARIOS FOR LARGE OUTBREAKSWhile the vast majority of patients with COVID-19 do not spread the infection at all and some spread the infection to only a couple of family members, there are some unique situations that have resulted in much more extensive spread \u2013 these have been dubbed \u201csuper spreading events\u201d.One of the first super-spreading events was the Diamond Princess cruise ship that remained off the coast of Japan for 14 days. Eventually, a total of 696 persons were infected out of 3,711 persons onboard, as well as some public health officers.Cruise ships are already well known for outbreaks of other highly infectious pathogens including the norovirus (known locally as \u201cstomach flu\u201d) and influenza for a variety of reasons, including the close quarters, risk of environmental contamination and generally older population.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Why Japan\u2019s move to close schools during COVID-19 outbreak upset many \u2013 and not just parentsCruise ships, including Costa Fortuna which berthed at Singapore this week, will continue to be watched carefully.Second, larger gatherings where people huddle together, sing or share food, can potentially lend themselves to huge outbreaks, if there happens to be someone shedding large quantities of virus.The huge and rapid outbreak in South Korea among members of a religious group, which has over 200,000 members, accounted for more than half of the over 7,000 cases of COVID-19 infections in the country.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Explosion in COVID-19 cases - was South Korea just unlucky?\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nInstead of taking the Chinese approach of locking down affected cities, South Korea has embraced a model of open information, public participation and widespread testing AFP/Jung Yeon-je\n                            \n\n                    \n                READ:\u00a0Commentary: The perfect storm for a COVID-19 outbreak lies in North KoreaThird, a large outbreak could happen in communities where there are big numbers of people susceptible to the virus. The nightmare scenario for public health is the COVID-19 outbreak at Life Care Center nursing home in Seattle, Washington, which has become one of the epicentres of the outbreak in the US after seeing at least five COVID-19 related deaths.Nursing homes have elderly patients with many comorbid conditions. Many live in close quarters with common staff and caretakers.Thus, there is always a risk of healthcare acquired infections which can spread rapidly, including influenza and other respiratory viruses, norovirus and other gastrointestinal illnesses. The COVID-19 outbreak has led to new screening, visiting and other precautionary measures in many nursing homes and assisted living facilities in the US.The fear remains that if such incidents occur in other long-term care facilities across the world, the toll on elderly or disabled people from COVID-19 will be significant.FOCUS ON MEDICAL DEVELOPMENTS, RELOOKING LARGE GATHERINGS AND ENCOURAGING TESTING\u00a0 Three areas of focus lie ahead in the fight against COVID-19.First, scientists are already working on treatments.

Doing so is an unpalatable prospect for policy elites in Beijing.Likewise, the US is unlikely to back down from taking a strong stance against Chinese activities in the South China Sea, where its credibility in meeting longstanding regional security commitments in the face of growing Chinese economic clout and military assertiveness is at stake.CHINA WILL PERSIST WITH INCREMENTAL ACTIONSEven as the US continues this position of exercising presence in the South China Sea through freedom of navigation operations and calling out China\u2019s activities, however, such actions are not likely to deter Beijing from taking incremental actions to push the envelop and assert its claims over the islands there.Working to China\u2019s advantage is also ASEAN\u2019s desire to maintain peace and stability.\u00a0Negotiations with Beijing on the proposed Code of Conduct in the South China Sea are expected to commence in August \u2013 also the same month when the inaugural ASEAN-China joint maritime exercise is scheduled to take place.

Common strategic interests and inter-dependencies may influence those choices.But there is also a second plausible scenario: The action-reaction spiral may reach a point where either or both powers decide that recurring aerial and maritime incidents risks turning into\u00a0a full-blown conflict involving more forces.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA Chinese navy formation, including the aircraft carrier Liaoning (C), during military drills in the South China Sea on Jan 2, 2017.

Late boomers and Gen-Xers like me, aged 45 to 64, are in the middle: nearly 3,500 of us died.Could we countenance a plan to allow the under-40s back into pubs and restaurants, while the rest of us stick to Zoom and Ocado? Then if signs of herd immunity emerged, we could send in the reserves \u2014 the 40-somethings like me.THE MORAL DILEMMAIs this really a good idea? I am genuinely unsure.Perhaps the practical objection is insuperable: it might be impossible to protect vulnerable people while allowing the virus to run riot in the young.But I suspect the real objection is not practical, but moral.

It now forecasts a plunge of 12 per cent between the last quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020 in advanced economies and a fall of 5 per cent in emerging and developing countries.THE OPTIMISTIC SCENARIO IS TOO OPTIMISTICBut, optimistically, the second quarter is forecast to be the nadir. Thereafter, it expects a recovery, though output in advanced economies is forecast to remain below fourth quarter 2019 levels until 2022.This \u201cbaseline\u201d assumes economic reopening in the second half of 2020.

A microbe has overthrown all our arrogance.NO EXPENSE MUST BE SPARED IN THE GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH FIGHTWhat must we do to manage this disaster? One answer is not to abandon the lockdowns before the death rate is brought under control.It will be impossible to reopen economies with a raging epidemic, increasing numbers of dead and pushing health systems into collapse. Even if we were allowed to buy or go back to work, many would not do so.But it is essential to prepare for that day, by creating vastly-enhanced capacities to test, trace, quarantine and treat people. No expense must now be spared on this, or on investment in creating, producing and using a new vaccine.Above all, as the introductory essay to a report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington on the essential role of the Group of 20 leading countries states: \u201cPut simply, in the COVID-19 pandemic, lack of international co-operation will mean that more people will die.\u201d\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nScientists around the world are racing to develop a coronavirus vaccine.

Both the pandemic and the Great Shutdown are global events. Help with the health response is essential, as Maurice Obstfeld, former IMF chief economist, stresses in the report.Yet so too is economic help for poorer countries, via debt relief, grants and cheap loans. A huge new issue of the IMF\u2019s special drawing rights, with transfer of unneeded allocations to poorer countries, is needed.The negative-sum economic nationalism that has driven Donald Trump throughout his term as US president, and has even emerged within the EU, is a serious danger. We need trade to flow freely, especially (but not solely) in medical equipment and supplies.\u00a0If the world economy is broken apart, as happened in response to the Depression, the recovery will be blighted, if not slain.READ: Commentary: The great COVID-19 race for protective medical gear and ventilatorsLISTEN: Home-based learning: Good, bad, terrible ... but mostly good?WE DON\u2019T KNOW A LOT BUT MUST DO MOREWe do not know what the pandemic has in store or how the economy will respond.

Peace is the goal. And the best way to get there is diplomacy. Pressure is not going to work.The more that North Koreans interact with the outside world, and the more that their economy integrates with the outside world, the more chance there is that their own living situation will improve. If the rest of the world cares about North Korean human rights, it needs to fully support engagement with North Korea.The only way to find out whether North Korea will denuclearise is to keep trying.\u00a0North Korea certainly can denuclearise and survive as a country, contrary to conventional wisdom that views nuclear weapons as the thin reed upon which the Kim family depends for its survival.It\u2019s not even totally clear whether North Korea has a deliverable nuclear weapons capability yet. It is close, to be sure \u2014 but the idea that Kim\u2019s regime only survives because of its nuclear deterrent overlooks the fact that North Korea achieved the possibility of a nuclear deterrent just last year.North Korea has survived for 65 years without a nuclear deterrent. It can defend itself and deter an attack with its conventional military and short-range missiles that could devastate Seoul and even Tokyo.In short, North Korea will not be helpless if it denuclearises. It will be where it was at only a few years earlier, with a massive conventional military. If Kim can resolve the relationship with the United States, he may not even need that.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nNorth Korea's leader Kim Jong Un met US President Donald Trump at a historic summit in Singapore.

The idea that if Kim denuclearises he will end up \"dead in a ditch\"\u00a0overlooks the fact that he is still a brutal dictator, and that there are no signs of any type of civil war or unrest within North Korea.Other countries may not like it, but Kim is in no danger of being overthrown from within.NOT A PROBLEM TO BE SOLVEDThe time for talk of \"maximum pressure\"\u00a0and a \"bloody nose\"\u00a0strike is finished.Kim has made concessions: A voluntary moratorium on missile testing, a voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing and dismantlement of the nuclear testing site. Sceptics argue that these are partial measures. But of course they are, that\u2019s the point \u2014 they are concessions, not irretrievable moves.And yes, Kim could restart North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile testing programmes. But as long as he does not, there will be almost no support from US allies and partners for military action or even for continuing economic pressure against North Korea, no matter what rhetoric comes from Washington.North Korea is not a problem to be solved. It is a country the world must learn to live with.Containment has never been successful. North Korea meets pressure with pressure of its own. Whether pressure on North Korean nuclear weapons, human rights or economic reform \u2014 all have failed.\u00a0To his credit, Trump\u2019s efforts at engagement and diplomacy have seen results.

As Peter W Singer and Emerson T Brooking write in their book LikeWar: The Weaponisation of Social Media, ISIS ran \u201ca military offensive like a viral marketing campaign and won a victory that shouldn\u2019t have been possible.\u201dSimilarly, the resurgent IS 2.0 uses press releases and social-media savvy to spread its influence worldwide and recruit foreign fighters, sympathisers and financial backers.In April 2019, for example, the group released a video of its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who claimed responsibility for the deadly Easter Sunday bomb attacks in Sri Lanka. IS\u2019s global media operation also produces Soldiers Harvest II, an upgraded weekly publication covering the group\u2019s military operations.READ:\u00a0Commentary: How the Easter Sunday bombings reshaped Sri Lanka\u2019s political landscapeREAD:\u00a0Commentary: Who bears responsibility for the children of Islamic State?This communications offensive is enabling IS to contest the global view that the group has been defeated following the collapse of its caliphate.Even more fundamentally, as Singer and Brooking point out, IS has weaponised the Internet itself, creating a digital battlespace in which an online narrative of victory can translate into success on the ground.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nWomen believed to have been the wives of Islamic State fighters, being held in the Kurdish-run Al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria.

Moreover, this fight is too important to leave only to the soldiers.The US National Security Strategy should thus recommend a collaborative model similar to the British Army\u2019s 77th Brigade, which combines government departments under one umbrella to conduct information warfare.Regrettably, the Trump administration has gutted the US State Department\u2019s Global Engagement Center, which originally countered terrorist propaganda and is now tasked with fighting global disinformation.Fortunately, Congress has pushed back; the State Department needs to be a full partner in developing a strong and credible counter-narrative, which requires much more nuance and range than traditional counter-propaganda.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe Islamic State group's elusive leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi resurfaced in a propaganda video, his first purported appearance since 2014 AFP/-\n                            \n\n                    \n                A CONTEST OF HOW THE WORLD IS SEENFurthermore, other countries fighting IS must ensure that they have similar capabilities and can collaborate with allies both diplomatically and militarily.\u00a0Information wars are contests between different ways of seeing and understanding the world, and they require new capabilities and expertise that extend well beyond traditional communications.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Islamic State brides and the meaning of citizenshipFinally, national and global media outlets face a quandary. On one hand, stories about IS press releases and interviews raise the visibility, and to some extent the attractiveness, of it and similar groups.A PRECURSOR TO PHYSICAL REVIVALOn the other hand, the significant decline in US media coverage of IS over the past few years strengthens the public perception that it is no longer a threat.Reporters and editors should be aware of this tension, and should perhaps examine more closely how the forces countering IS worldwide are engaging with the public.Publicity is the lifeblood of all terrorist groups; they use attacks to raise awareness of their cause and to attract the support of the disaffected.READ:\u00a0Commentary: What comes after a US withdrawal from Afghanistan?Moreover, digital technologies allow IS to\u00a0control parts of the virtual landscape in a way it rarely can on the ground, enabling it to regroup and find new ways to mount physical attacks.IS\u2019s recent media resurgence is thus the precursor to the group\u2019s physical revival.

Now that constraint will soon be gone, leaving US international relations hugely less predictable.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementREAD:\u00a0Last man standing Jim Mattis exits Trump's 'axis of adults', a commentaryThere are four most immediate implications of Mattis' departure.1.

A more unfettered Trump may well be more isolationist, but also potentially more prone to dramatic, impulsive action.2. IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AMERICA WILL LET OTHERS CALL THE SHOTSMattis\u2019 resignation letter indicates that Trump\u2019s unexpected announcement of an immediate US troop withdrawal from Syria, coupled with a pullback of troops from Afghanistan, was the last straw for the defense secretary.Throughout the Trump presidency, the Pentagon has advocated ferociously for more resources for both conflicts despite the president\u2019s long-running antipathy towards long-term military interventions in the region.If Trump goes ahead with the withdrawal, there will be dramatic implications on the ground. In Syria, the move will likely embolden both Turkey and the Russian-backed forces of President Bashar al-Assad fighting against America\u2019s former Syrian Kurdish allies.\u00a0European states \u2013 most likely led by Syria\u2019s former colonial power France \u2013 will have to decide fast if they wish to fill the gap left by the US departure.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS\u00a0troops based around the Syrian town of Manbij speaking with residents\u00a0in northern Syria.

ASIAN AND EUROPEAN ALLIES WILL BE NERVOUSThroughout Trump\u2019s two years in office, much of Mattis\u2019 role has been to travel the globe placating America\u2019s allies and reassuring them of Washington\u2019s long-term support. His departure will leave them wondering what those guarantees were worth \u2013 and watching the White House closely for signs of how policy will now change.The biggest question will be whether Trump attempts to tamper with US commitments in Europe and Asia, where Washington has continued to step up military activity in the face of increasingly assertive Russian and Chinese action.Trump has been repeatedly critical of America\u2019s allies, saying they have done too little to secure their own defence and have become too reliant on Washington\u2019s spending.After his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June, Trump shocked many in his own administration by pledging to cease joint exercises with South Korea in the hope of reducing tensions.READ:\u00a0Deferring the resumption of South Korea-US military drills a key aim for China, a commentaryThe real nightmare for many in the Pentagon, NATO and beyond is that he may now do the same with military activities in Europe, Asia, or both, possibly emboldening America\u2019s most powerful potential foes and driving up the chances of an inadvertent conflict.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA US Air Force F-22 Raptor lands at Gwangju Air Base in South Korea during the Max Thunder drills in May.

AMERICA MAY BECOME MORE ISOLATIONIST AND VOLATILEAny appointee will have to embrace a Trumpian worldview that is more isolationist and sometimes more reactionary than much of the US national security establishment would wish.What that means is remarkably hard to model \u2013 not least because Trump himself has been so inconsistent. He has talked repeatedly about building a strong US military \u2013 but last month suggested he might cut it as part of the deal to slow the arms race.\u00a0He has been openly cautious of military action \u2013 but stepped up US airstrikes in Afghanistan and elsewhere.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nDeputy Secretary of Defence Patrick Shanahan (right)\u00a0listening\u00a0as President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, in Washington, DC, on Apr 9, 2018.

That dynamic is now in play on a global scale, and it could go either way.Also complicating matters is Trump\u2019s political position at home, where he faces a deadlocked Congress, the endgame of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into alleged collusion with Russia and the start of the 2020 presidential campaign.Bottom line: 2019 was already looking volatile. The departure of Mattis makes it dramatically more so.Peter Apps is Reuters global affairs columnist, writing on international affairs, globalisation, conflict and other issues. "},

The right-wing response that silences rich people with left-leaning views may look reasonable at first, but it is a non-sequitur.You can be well-off, rich, or super-rich, and unwilling to give up your wealth unilaterally, yet still think the system that has allowed you to earn and accumulate so much is unfair. There is no contradiction or hypocrisy in such a stance.Some of the world\u2019s finest thinkers concur. The British philosopher Bertrand Russell famously argued (clearly with himself in mind) that smoking good cigars should not debar one from being a socialist.And American economist Paul Samuelson made a similar point in My Life Philosophy, an essay he published in 1983. Samuelson became quite wealthy thanks to the phenomenal success of his textbook Economics, which was required reading for undergraduate students all over the world for decades.

Young Friedrich became radicalised seeing child labor and the suffering of the working classes.Later in life, Engels returned to work for his inherited business so that he could support the efforts of his friend, Karl Marx, to put an end to that kind of profit. No matter what one thinks of the desirability or viability of Marx\u2019s precise proposal, the yearning to rectify gross social inequalities is surely admirable.HOPE TODAYThere is hope today, too.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos faces mounting criticism over working conditions and low tax payments.Yet none of this looks set to stop tech firms from continuing to radically disrupt the world \u2013 indeed, many of their founders appear to believe their mission is to do so. Expect these battles to grow in 2019, particularly if new technology such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars accelerate change.2. TRUMP FIRES ADVISERS, TIGHTENS HIS GRIPOne billionaire learning his way around the political system in 2018 was US\u00a0President Donald Trump.\u00a0After reports of growing frustration with some of his most senior officials, March saw him fire\u00a0Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Adviser HR\u00a0McMaster. Both had been viewed as moderating influences on Trump, with successors Mike Pompeo and John Bolton perceived as less prone to questioning him.December saw the\u00a0departure of White House Chief of Staff John Kelly\u00a0Defence Secretary James Mattis will leave in February.READ:\u00a0Last man standing Jim Mattis exits Trump's axis of adults, a commentaryOverall, Trump seems increasingly keen to trust his own judgement rather than that of establishment-based gatekeepers or Republican insiders.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson was fired by Trump after a rocky tenure of less than 14 months.

ELSEWHERE, DIPLOMACY UNRAVELSIn Singapore in June and in Helsinki in July, Trump upset many in his own administration with the warmth of his meetings with North Korean leader\u00a0Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The friendliness of the summits stood in stark contrast to the G7 gathering of Western and Allied leaders in Canada, also in June.\u00a0READ: Kim Jong Un, the modern, strange and brilliant leader of North Korea, a commentaryThere, Trump appeared more isolated than ever before on topics including climate change, protectionism and relations with Russia. The G7 leaders were unable to agree on a communique, with the six non-US\u00a0members making their own statement independent of Washington.Events at the G7 pointed to a wider malaise in international diplomacy. World leaders at November\u2019s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Papua New Guinea also failed to agree on a communique, this time due to divisions between China and the United States and its allies over trade.READ:\u00a0APEC reveals irreconcilable visions of the future between US, China, a commentaryMilitary posturing is also on the rise.

KHASHOGGI KILLED AS AUTHORITARIAN STATES TAKE THE GLOVES OFFThe world\u2019s authoritarian states appeared at least equally as focused on stifling dissent and opposition. Nowhere was that clearer than in the case of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered and reportedly dismembered in his own country\u2019s consulate building in Istanbul.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nPeople hold banners of Jamal Khashoggi during a symbolic funeral prayer for the Saudi journalist, in Istanbul (Photo: AFP/BULENT KILIC)\n                            \n\n                    \n                READ:\u00a0The Khashoggi tragedy and America\u2019s obsolete Middle East fixation, a commentaryLike the suspected Russian nerve agent assassination attempt on a former double agent in the UK town of Salisbury the previous year, the killing sparked international outrage and some diplomatic isolation of Riyadh \u2013 but little in the way of convincing apology from those believed responsible.A string of autocratic governments appear increasingly dismissive of human rights, openly taking draconian action against critics and enemies alike. Russia is continuing its ruthless military campaign against remaining rebel enclaves in Syria, and a Saudi-led coalition has persisted in its war in Yemen \u2013 at catastrophic cost to civilians, where millions now face starvation.China is cracking down on its Muslim Uighur minority, with a UN\u00a0report citing estimates Beijing has interned up to one million in \u201creeducation camps.\u201d Such steps suggest rulers like China\u2019s Xi Jinping and Russia\u2019s Putin may not feel as secure as they appear \u2013 or that they believe such brutal tactics are simply necessary to retain their grip.5. G20 MEETS AS PARIS BURNSNovember\u2019s G20 gathering in Argentina was perhaps the year\u2019s most successful multilateral gathering, with world leaders managing to agree on a largely bland communique\u00a0on reform of global trade.\u00a0Trump\u2019s meeting with China\u2019s Xi brought some temporary relief from the two countries\u2019 trade war, even as Ukraine tensions and Mueller\u2019s Russia probe made a Trump-Putin meeting impossible. There was still no shortage of disagreements on show, however \u2013 and as the leaders met, riots in Paris were grabbing global headlines.READ:\u00a0Mueller now one step closer in long road to prosecuting Donald Trump, a commentary\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nUS\u00a0President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend a working dinner after the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina on Dec 1, 2018.

He thereby abandoned the Sunni tribal militias that had helped US forces defeat al Qaeda and drove the survivors into Syria to the mercies of a corrupt Shia-dominated government.In 2014, when those al Qaeda remnants, now reorganised as Islamic State, burst out of Syria, nothing appeared to stand between them and Baghdad. Only the combined efforts of the United States and Iran allowed the Iraqi government to hold its capital and eventually retake the rest of its territory.Trump\u2019s desire to withdraw from Syria is consistent with his and his predecessor\u2019s national strategies, but the manner in which the decision has been taken is highly counterproductive. Surprise as a device to throw one\u2019s adversaries off balance has utility, but this decision has only discomfited America\u2019s friends.The United States leads a multi-national military coalition in Syria, none of whom were consulted. Several of Syria\u2019s neighbours, notably Israel and Iraq, are going to be negatively affected.The most immediately impacted will be America\u2019s partners on the ground, the Kurdish-dominated militias that have done most of the fighting and dying in the largely successful and still ongoing campaign against Islamic State.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nFighters of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces parade at the funeral on November 11, 2018 of a comrade killed in the campaign against the Islamic State group.

If true, this would not be the first time for this or any other president.But the apparently impulsive nature of this decision, heedless of evident consequences, uncoordinated with allies or even among the relevant US agencies should be cause for alarm.With the arrival of a new Congress in January, American domestic politics is\u00a0likely to become even more turbulent.

Before the first summit, Trump promised to totally and immediately denuclearise North Korea.Unfortunately, the Singapore Joint Declaration only committed the North to a vague disarmament pledge after the establishment of new US-North Korea relations and a peace regime on the peninsula.Now that Trump has relaxed his CVID rhetoric, saying that Washington no longer had a timeline for denuclearisation, it is even less likely that\u00a0the two leaders will sign a significant arms control agreement during the second summit.More dangerously, Trump may attempt to declare an end to the Korean War to increase the coverage of the event, without thinking about the consequences of such a move for the presence of US troops on South Korean soil.US NEEDS TO ACKNOWLEDGE N.KOREA AS NUCLEAR POWERIt is instead time for the US to recognise North Korea as a de facto nuclear power and engage in only ministerial-level dialogues, to avoid giving Pyongyang too much global attention.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nMany say North Korea has made a great progress in its nuclear and missile capabilities since Kim Jong-Un (pictured) took power after the death of his father and longtime ruler, Kim Jong-Il, in 2011 (Photo: AFP/-)\n                            \n\n                    \n                The presidential-level summit so far has not persuaded Pyongyang to make verifiable and irreversible concessions, while another summit of that scale would rationalise its pursuit of its nuclear capability in the first place.Acknowledging that North Korea is a nuclear power does not spell the end of the US-led non-proliferation regime, but it will help the US work with North Korea from a more realistic standpoint.READ: Here are the real reasons why Kim Jong Un wants an end to the Korean War, a commentaryFuture dialogues can still aim at gradual freezing of the North\u2019s nuclear weapons and implementing sanctions relief in proportionate\u00a0to the value of Pyongyang\u2019s concessions.From now to December, the two Koreas will try hard to lobby for the second Trump-Kim summit.

This is so that those who suffer the most acute symptoms are able to receive the necessary medical support without overwhelming the National Health Service (NHS) with cases.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementAt face value, this seems like a sound strategy, but what exactly is herd immunity and can it be used to combat COVID-19?READ: UK defends COVID-19 plan as 'wartime' measures loomLISTEN: Beyond COVID-19, how do we take Singapore's public hygiene standards to the next level?HOW HERD IMMUNITY WORKS\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementOur bodies fight infectious diseases through the actions of our immune systems. When we recover, we often retain an immunological memory of the disease that enables us to fight off that same disease in the future.\u00a0This is how vaccines work, creating this immune memory without requiring getting sick with the disease.If you have a new disease, such as COVID-19, that we don\u2019t have a vaccine for and no one in the country has ever been infected with, the disease will spread through the population.But if enough people develop an immune memory, then the disease will stop spreading, even if some of the population is not immune. This is herd immunity, and it is a very effective way to protect the whole of a population against an infectious disease.\n    AdvertisementBut herd immunity is typically only viewed as a preventive strategy in vaccination programmes. If we don\u2019t have a vaccine \u2013 as we don\u2019t for COVID-19 \u2013 achieving herd immunity would require a significant proportion of the population to be infected and recover from COVID-19.So what would this mean for the spread of the disease in the UK?\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA sign directs patients towards an NHS 111 Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pod, where people who believe they may be suffering from the virus can attend and speak to doctors, at St Thomas' Hospital in London.

This is measured by the term R0, which is how many new infections each case will generate.For COVID-19, the R0 is estimated to be 3.28, though studies are still ongoing and this number will probably change. This means that for herd immunity, about 70 per cent of the UK population would need to be immune to COVID-19.Achieving herd immunity would require well over 47 million people to be infected in the UK. Current estimates are that COVID-19 has a 2.3 per cent case-fatality rate and a 19 per cent rate of severe disease.This means that achieving herd immunity to COVID-19 in the UK could result in the deaths of more a million people with a further 8 million severe infections requiring critical care.READ: Commentary: Italy\u2019s struggle with coronavirus threatens all of EuropeREAD: Commentary: UAE fights COVID-19 while the rest of the Middle East drags its feetDELAY AS A PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGYHowever, it is not clear how much of this discussion of herd immunity \u2013 reportedly proposed by David Halpern, chief executive of the Behavioural Insights Team, and later blogged about by Robert Peston \u2013 shapes\u00a0government policy.Also, the concept as discussed is not simply to let the disease run its course through the population, but to slow its spread and protect those most vulnerable from severe disease.Slowing the spread of COVID-19 is a promising strategy, especially when combined with enhanced measures to protect the elderly and those with underlying health conditionsBy slowing the spread of the disease, the NHS might have more time to prepare, we might be able to develop treatments or vaccines and we will be closer to the summer when we have lower incidences of other diseases that burden the NHS, such as the flu.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nCommuters walk through Canary Wharf, as the number of coronavirus cases grow around the world and as European stocks plunge into bear market territory, in London, Britain March 9, 2020.

This means that even in this unlikely \u201cbest case\u201d scenario we would still be looking at more than 236,000 deaths.We can and we must do better than that.

There are limits to how far science can determine decisions which are, ultimately, political in nature.Italy, as the European country at the forefront of the crisis, has had little to draw on except the response in China. A hardline government policy appears to be working but comes with challenges in taking\u00a0action. Countries like Italy have less compliant political cultures so any large-scale measures will necessarily play out differently.The Italian government\u2019s approach has been modelled on the Chinese, involving a hardline response designed to contain the virus through the establishment of \u201cno-go\u201d areas, restrictions on movement combined with massive testing for the virus.READ: Commentary: Japan shows how not to deal with a COVID-19 outbreakREAD: Commentary: Why Japan\u2019s move to close schools during COVID-19 outbreak upset many \u2013 and not just parentsAt the same time, conscious of the criticisms of China\u2019s lack of transparency, the Italian government has been completely open about its decision-making. It has been providing extensive information about the spread of the virus at regional and provincial levels in order to educate and inform people of the critical nature of the emergency.The press has reproduced this data in the form of daily interactive \u201ccontagion maps\u201d, allowing the reader to drill down to see precisely where the reported cases are located.REDRAWING THE MAPThis approach \u2013 hardline but transparent \u2013 is generating visible social divisions. The whole of northern Italy, from the beginning of the outbreak, has been increasingly characterised as a kind of pariah state, even though the initial red zones were in relatively small areas.That was reflected not only when other countries began to discourage or restrict travel to areas in the north, but also in the Italian media and the public response. There have been examples of outright discrimination towards Italians living in \u201cinfected areas\u201d, who were less\u00a0welcomed in other parts of the country.This is a paradoxical reversal of Italy\u2019s traditional north-south divide.

The risk is that losing control of the contagion can\u00a0lead to a complete collapse of the national health system there, since it is nowhere near as robust as Lombardy, the worst hit region of the north.There are only around 1,500 intensive care beds in the seven regions of the south and islands and a chronic shortage, in some areas, of specialised medical personnel.Filippo Anelli, president of the National Federation of Doctors, said:\u00a0If Lombardy is struggling, imagine what will happen in the south, where there are enormous disadvantages in terms of equipment and personnel.He spoke of the likely need for field hospitals and military back-up, especially in regions such as Calabria and Molise.To confront the looming economic devastation, the government is rushing through a package of emergency measures in a decree worth \u20ac7.5 billion (US$8.5 billion), which raises this year\u2019s projected national economic deficit from 2.2 to 2.5 per cent.This will offset the extra costs of health and civil protection, unemployment, support for businesses and banks and so on \u2013 all measures which will need approval by the European Commission. Yet, the long-term economic impact of the lockdown is incalculable.READ: Commentary: COVID-19 could redefine Singapore\u2019s place in the global economyREAD: Commentary: The great COVID-19 disruption to Asian economies has begunPOLITICAL POTSHOTSPresident Sergio Mattarella has\u00a0intervened.

Leader of the far right League, Matteo Salvini, has said Conte is \u201cnot up to managing the crisis\u201d. He has indicated that his party will vote against the batch of economic measures in parliament.If, Italy is on a war footing, it is not exhibiting any real sense of national unity. Managing a public health crisis in a democracy involves striking a balance between measures protecting citizens and the social and economic impact of those decisions.The jury is still out on whether Italy has successfully struck the right balance.

His airlines were struggling.The challenger bank he had assembled by merging Virgin Money with CYBG (which owns the Clydesdale and Yorkshire brands) was wrestling with liabilities relating to past mis-selling of payment protection insurance policies. Since the deal in 2018, its share price had fallen by about two-thirds.\n    AdvertisementREAD: Virgin Money profits erased by coronavirus provisionBut the pandemic has done much more than just increase the pressure on his airlines, while also putting the tin lid on some of his other leisure ventures (such as the new Virgin Cruises).That was perhaps predictable given the unfortunate spread of Virgin\u2019s branded activities \u2013 almost all heavily exposed to the impact of the coronavirus.LISTEN: COVID-19: Aviation and flying never ever the same againAN UNAPPETISING REALITYCOVID-19 has ripped off the showman\u2019s whiskers, revealing the less-than-appetising reality that lies beneath.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nSir Richard Branson poses outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ahead of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) trading in New York, U.S., October 28, 2019.

There\u2019s no sign now of the apostle of competition, who demanded that weak airlines be allowed to fail as recently as 2009.The \u201ccommercial loan\u201d he seeks is needed because the airline \u2013 which has not made a profit since 2016 and had negative net worth on its latest balance sheet \u2013 could not qualify even for any of the government\u2019s subsidised business assistance loans.EasyJet, by contrast, got over the line because of its more conservative financials, not through selective state assistance as Sir Richard has implied.READ: Commentary: Singapore\u2019s aviation and tourism recovery will be very slow after COVID-19 but long-term outlook remains brightThen there is the PR own-goal of an extraordinary open letter he penned to fend off his critics.First off, Sir Richard tackles the question of his tax residence, which is understandably sensitive when you\u2019re pitching for taxpayers\u2019 money at a time of massive public deficits.There is no reason to doubt him when he says he chose to live on Necker Island because of its physical, rather than its fiscal, charms. But was it then really necessary to register his kingpin holding company in the disclosure-free tax haven that is the British Virgin Islands as well?READ: Commentary: MNCs have gotten away with paying less taxes. That must changeNext comes the statement on Virgin\u2019s embarrassing lawsuit against Britain\u2019s NHS, which is something that might come from Mr Barnacle of the Circumlocution Office in Dickens\u2019 Little Dorrit.The facts are, briefly, that there was a lawsuit and Virgin Care, an NHS contractor, extracted damages from the health service over a commercial contract it lost out on \u2013 although a casual reading might persuade you that the opposite was the case.Virgin says that neither the group nor Sir Richard pocketed money from the settlement.\u00a0A BILLIONAIRE\u2019S TRUST FUNDNow, none of these are exactly hanging offences. We know Virgin is quick to fight his corner when it comes to government contracts.Remember how it appealed successfully against the UK Department for Transport\u2019s decision when it lost the competition to run the West Coast main line?\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFILE PHOTO: A Virgin Train travels along the West Coast Mainline near Preston, Britain, August 14, 2019.

This is less an exciting entrepreneurial group than a billionaire\u2019s trust fund, wearily coughing up royalty payments for use of the brand back to the treasure island HQ.\u00a0It\u2019s long been a source of mystery why the paying public keeps buying into Sir Richard\u2019s increasingly vestigial buccaneering image, shelling out for memberships in his pricey and not very glamorous gyms or \u2013 even more puzzlingly \u2013 investing in ISAs with Virgin Money (a venture Sir Richard once promised with comic chutzpah would deliver his objective of a \u201cfairer distribution of wealth\u201d).READ: Commentary: Bitter truths for Singapore Airlines about this aviation industry crashREAD: Commentary: Flying will be leaner, maybe even more responsible, after COVID-19The daredevil stunts are long gone. Forget ballooning round the world or abseiling down buildings.These days Sir Richard seems happier hobnobbing with global bigwigs at meetings of The Elders, the celebrity talking shop he set up to seek solutions to the world\u2019s intractable problems.There is a concept in television that describes the moment when a show that was once popular but has grown less so makes an attempt at publicity, which serves only to highlight its waning relevance.With its ill-judged pitch for public assistance, it\u2019s worth asking whether Virgin\u2019s PR machine has finally jumped the shark."},

The Taliban, the de facto rulers of much of Afghanistan in the wake of a bloody civil war, had given bin Laden and his supporters shelter.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementTwo months into the US\u00a0invasion, Taliban state institutions and defensive positions crumbled and the United States formed new state institutions led by Afghans who had fought the Taliban.\u00a0The US maintained a limited force to fight and capture al Qaeda and Taliban leaders but otherwise invested little in the Afghan economy or society.It took the Taliban four years to reconstitute itself as an effective force of insurgents to fight the US\u00a0and the Afghan government, and they became stronger every year after 2004.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nMore than 2,750 people were killed when two passenger jets crashed into the World Trade Center during the 9/11 attacks in 2001.

More than 5,000 American soldiers and contractors were killed.Today, a US\u00a0force of 14,000 troops and massive US\u00a0Airforce assets are helping maintain the defensive positions of an Afghan government that is widely considered as one of the most corrupt in the world.The Taliban is\u00a0making territorial gains and killing hundreds of regime troops each month. They feel that they are on the cusp of victory.Militias that recruit from the Hazara, Tajik and Uzbek minorities have rearmed in anticipation of the collapse of the regime in Kabul and fear of a coming civil war with the mostly Pushtun Taliban. Afghanistan is nearing an endgame.WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE TALIBANAn agreement between the Taliban and the US\u00a0would be an impressive accomplishment for the Taliban. From their perspective, it would be their reward for fighting the world\u2019s strongest military power and holding them to a stalemate.They were already\u00a0rewarded when they got to\u00a0negotiate directly with the United States, as they have always requested, instead of the Afghan regime which they despise. If the negotiations are successful, they would also be getting precisely what they asked for: An American withdrawal.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe announcement signals a growing confidence among the Taliban for US troops to pull out of Afghanistan (Photo: AFP/WAKIL KOHSAR)\n                            \n\n                    \n                In return, they are making a commitment to do something they would likely have done anyway. Al Qaeda\u2019s attack on the US\u00a0caused the Taliban to lose control of Afghanistan for years. They are not likely to risk having to pay that cost again once they regain control of Kabul, even if they don\u2019t sign an agreement.WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE USThere is little hope for an outright US\u00a0victory over the Taliban at this point.The remaining force of 14,000 US\u00a0troops is mostly meant to shore up Afghan state defences. It is too small to reverse momentum on the battlefield.\u00a0An agreement and withdrawal would therefore be attractive for those who value less military spending and stress on the military, including General John Nicholson, the previous commander of the American and NATO forces in Afghanistan.READ:\u00a0Getting the US out of Middle East purgatory, a commentaryThe agreement, however, could undermine US reputation in ways big and small. The Obama and Trump administrations never reversed a 2002 Bush executive order that added the Taliban to the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists, but they have simultaneously pleaded with them to negotiate in spite of claims that Washington does not negotiate with terrorists.It also signals US\u00a0weakness and inability to fight a dedicated force of insurgents. Militants elsewhere, including Islamic State leaders, could find this lesson instructive.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nUS\u00a0military personnel pass in front of a US\u00a0A-10 aircraft, one of a squadron that has arrived to step up the fight against the Taliban, at the Kandahar air base, Afghanistan January 23, 2018.

Different regime militias and military units either disintegrated, joined their erstwhile Mujahideen opponents or became independent militias.Similarly, today\u2019s Afghan state officials at all levels have long hedged their bets by maintaining ties with the Taliban, their nominal opponents and minority militias.\u00a0If history is any indication, we can expect that entire agencies and units will either fragment or collectively join any of several strongman-led ethnic militias when the rewards of working for the regime stop outweighing the risks of facing the Taliban.\u00a0Some may even defect to the Taliban. This is expected behavior in dangerous environments such as Afghanistan, where everyone is expected to have a hedging strategy for survival.Once the state gets pulled in all directions, Afghanistan will likely degenerate into a civil war very similar to the one that the United States interrupted when it invaded in late 2001.\u00a0Other countries, including Russia, Iran and India will choose sides to back. I estimate that the Taliban, with their dedicated Pakistani and Arab Gulf backers will win that conflict, just like they almost did in 2001.\u00a0We may very well reach a point where we see the 17-year American occupation as merely a futile, bloody and costly interruption of the Afghan civil war.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nPakistan has long wielded influence over the militants. (Photo: AFP/FAROOQ NAEEM)\n                            \n\n                    \n                I consider a US-Taliban agreement to be no more than a face-saving measure to conclude a failed and costly American military intervention.\u00a0If there is a useful lesson to be learned from this misadventure, it is that leaders of even the world\u2019s mightiest military power need to reconsider the merits of a militarised foreign policy in the Muslim world.\u00a0US\u00a0military interventions are stoking resentment and inflaming a perpetual transnational insurgency across Muslim countries. If it doesn\u2019t change its course, the US\u00a0may very well suffer more defeats such as the one in Afghanistan and will cause even more hurt and damage in other countries along the way.Abdulkader Sinno is associate professor of Political Science and Middle Eastern Studies at\u00a0Indiana University.

They have names like Shamima, Mathilde and Hoda. Some are barely adults; others are now nearing middle-age. Some are repenting their sins; others remain defiant.These are the western women lured to Syria and Iraq to marry Islamic State\u00a0fighters.

This time, it is over the responsibility of states towards them and the rights and obligations attached to citizenship.From London\u00a0to Paris and Washington, governments are trying to wash their hands off the women. Some are turning a blind eye to their existence, while others seek to strip the dual nationals among them of their citizenship (international law prohibits revoking citizenship only if it renders the person stateless).\u00a0In the US, the authorities have argued that Hoda Muthana from Alabama should have never been given her American citizenship in the first place.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nAn undated photograph obtained on Feb\u00a020, 2019, shows Hoda Muthana, a 24-year-old woman from Alabama.

The UK Home Office says her citizenship will be revoked, arguing that she has an alternative nationality, though Bangladesh insists it will not grant it.\u00a0For now at least, she will remain in an internment camp in Syria. Her case, which is likely to play out in the courts, has raised an important question: Are citizenship rights for dual nationals more conditional than those of single nationals?\n    AdvertisementA NEW,\u00a0COMPLEX SECURITY RISKI have listened to the debate in recent weeks with a mixture of understanding and apprehension. Understanding because these women and their children pose a complex new security risk.\u00a0Apprehension because western societies should have the legal and security tools and the political will to deal with extreme cases without resorting to extraordinary measures. Apprehension also because of the disturbing message inherent in a revocation of citizenship of dual nationals: That children of immigrants are less British than others.According to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at King\u2019s College London, up to 4,761 foreign women joined Islamic State\u00a0in Syria and Iraq, nearly half of them from western countries.\u00a0Only a small fraction has been repatriated.

The Kurdish group holding the Islamic State\u00a0women complains that they are a burden.\u00a0In theory, the women could be put on trial where they are \u2014 except that the Syrian state is even more brutal than the Islamic State. In any case, its remit does not extend to the Kurdish-controlled areas where the women are detained.The rationale for ignoring those brides is that it may be impossible to establish evidence against them. Deradicalisation programmes also have a patchy record and rehabilitation would require resources, as would surveilling them. The easiest solution is to keep them at arm\u2019s reach.READ:\u00a0Why the use of women and children raises the stakes in the fight against terrorism, a commentaryYet, Gina Vale, co-author of the ICSR report tracing the women and children of Isis, argues that it would be safer for western societies if the women were all repatriated.\u00a0Otherwise, she says, they could be extradited to third countries or used in detainee exchanges within the region. If so, they could pose a long-term security threat.\u201cHaving them in position so we can identify them and locate them and give them access to rehabilitation programmes is preferable to losing track of our civilians and setting potential security threats in the region,\u201d she says.She is right. Governments that fail to take responsibility for their nationals may be guarding against short-term risk but exacerbating long-term security implications."},

No way.\u201dWei had also send a clear and unequivocal signal regarding Taiwan as a red line in the sand for China. \u201cNo attempts to split China will succeed,\u201d he added.\u00a0Any interference in the Taiwan question is doomed to failure. If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military has no choice but to fight at all costs.\u201cThe US is indivisible and so is China. China must be and will be reunified.\u201dA COMMITMENT TO PEACEDespite the strong words used by both sides, what went under the radar were\u00a0the conciliatory remarks in each of their speeches.China is at an inflection point where its focus is to maintain sustainable and inclusive growth, as it begins to grapple with the challenges of being the world\u2019s fastest ageing country.\u00a0While it seeks to defend its interests of preserving a conducive international environment for continued development, it also has to be wary about unnecessarily giving into US demands and setting a precedence inimical to its interests.There are many in China who believe that the US is out to encircle China through a string of alliances and partnerships with countries around China\u2019s periphery and dampen its rise.Despite Wei\u2019s pugnacious speech, he also reaffirmed Beijing\u2019s longheld commitment to peace by saying:\u00a0\u201cChina will not attack, unless we are attacked.\" He also\u00a0highlighted how both sides should \u201cpromote a China-US relationship featuring coordination, cooperation and stability\u201d.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nChinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe speaks at the IISS Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, June 2, 2019.

Both sides are clutching onto misguided viewpoints\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nUS\u00a0National Security Advisor John Bolton speaks during a graduation ceremony at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, U.S., May 22, 2019.

He\u00a0said the \u201cfundamental problem between the US and China \u2026 is a mutual lack of trust\u201d that \u201cbodes ill for compromise or peaceful accommodation\u201d.\u201cChina\u2019s growth has shifted the strategic balance and the economic centre of gravity of the world ... China has to recognise that it is in a totally new situation created by its own success. It can no longer expect to be treated the same way as in the past when it was much smaller and weaker,\u201d he said.READ:\u00a0In full: PM Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s speech at the 2019 Shangri-La DialogueAt the same time, he highlighted that \u201cthe rest of the world too has to adjust to a larger role for China. Countries have to accept that China will continue to grow and strengthen, and that it is neither possible nor wise for them to prevent this from happening\u201d.President Trump needs to restore trade talks with China, recognise that both sides have got to work together to rebuild trust and strengthen the international global economy, and rein in elements that might wish to take a harsh stance on China for ideological reasons.Meanwhile, Beijing has to demonstrate it can uphold the principles and standards on trade, technology and intellectual property if President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping do sign a US-China trade agreement in Osaka on the sidelines of the G20\u00a0and demonstrate good faith in the lead-up to that meeting.The trade deal can only succeed if both countries follow the rules and guidelines that will be stated in the agreement.If there is any bright spot from this year\u2019s Shangri-La Dialogue, it\u2019s the realisation that a small country like Singapore can play a useful mediating role between both sides as a neutral observer that has deep and close ties with both the US and China, and rich insights that\u00a0gives both perspective to their relationship.The words used by Prime Minister Lee in Singapore has provided a face-saving cover for both sides to step back from the brink and break the impasse. What is needed next is for both to accept compromise and allow for concessions in any upcoming trade negotiations.Tom McGregor is a commentator on Asia-Pacific affairs based in Beijing."},

In turn, Javid has stated during questions in the House of Commons that:The death of any British child, even those children born to a foreign terrorist fighter, of course is a tragedy. But the only person responsible for the death of that child is the foreign terrorist fighter.Until now, little has been done to repatriate minors. Previously, it was felt that there was no urgency to deal with this issue; they were mostly being held in camps in Northern Syria either with a remaining parent or family member, detained in Iraq or residing in what was left of the so-called caliphate.OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementHowever, US President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to announce US troop withdrawal in December, the instability that this could cause in the camps, and the potential dispersion of terrorist fighters, has focused sudden attention.READ:\u00a0Trump's Syria withdrawal - right idea, just wrong time, a commentaryIn an attempt to trace the women and children of the caliphate, a 2018\u00a0report\u00a0released by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, Kings College London, put known Australian Islamic State\u00a0affiliates remaining in Syria at 30 to 40 female and 70 minors.\u00a0It is not a large number, but little is known about many of them.

Although he was the first citizen to be stripped of Australian citizenship in 2015, at the time of leaving Australia for the caliphate, both parents were Australian citizens.\u00a0Their children were all born in Australia; their citizenship is not in question. The eldest child, Zaynab, subsequently married a 31-year-old Australian man, Mohamed Elomar, and bore two children. Elomar died, leaving Zaynab as \u201corphan, widow, and mother\u201d and carer to her two, remaining, younger siblings.\u00a0Karen Nettleton, the maternal grandmother to the children, has repeatedly stated that she would support her grandchildren, and her now great-grandchildren, in their re-assimilation into Australia, should the government facilitate their return.However, the role of the wife in Islamic State\u00a0was to raise the lion-cubs to fulfil the role of multi-generational jihad. It is a fair assumption that Zaynab Sharrouf would\u00a0have fulfilled this role to remain in the caliphate without her parents for as long as she has.\u00a0READ:\u00a0Islamic State brides and the meaning of citizenship, a commentaryThere is also some evidence to suggest that the Sharrouf children have been living in close connection with another Australian Islamic State\u00a0member, Zehra Duman, known to be an unrepentant Islamic State\u00a0fighter and best friend of their mother.The case of Zehra Duman and her children is not so clear-cut. Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison had previously stated in early March\u00a0he was\u00a0considering the removal of her citizenship, as she holds dual Australian and Turkish citizenship; at this time we do not know if this has, indeed, happened.\u00a0CHILD'S NATIONALITYIn light of the new video of the Australian woman in Syria, widely believed to be Zehra Duman, the prime minister reiterated his position that there will be no Australian assistance in her repatriation or that of her children.Although Duman initially married an Australian Islamic State fighter, it is unlikely that her children are a product of this marriage as he was killed five weeks after their union. She did remarry, but it is uncertain if the children are from this marriage.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nIS fighter Khaled Sharrouf is the first Australian to be stripped of his citizenship under anti-terrorism laws (Photo: AFP/DELIL SOULEIMAN)\n                            \n\n                    \n                It is therefore difficult to determine what other nationality these children may have. It is not even known if any children in accompaniment of Zehra Duman are actually hers.\u00a0It may be assumed that many of the orphans of the caliphate have been unofficially adopted by other members.\u00a0This would require DNA testing to determine familial connection and hence state responsibility.\u00a0In light of the criticisms being faced by UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid, we may see more Islamic State\u00a0women claiming that their children are ill to hasten repatriation.READ:\u00a0What comes after a US withdrawal from Afghanistan? A commentarySECURITY RISKThe Sharrouf children should be allowed to return. They are confirmed citizens of Australia and they are all minors.\u00a0Do they pose a security risk? Potentially.\u00a0That must be assessed on their return and dealt with according to local and international law. The Duman children require a different approach; parental connection through DNA testing needs to be established prior to any thought of repatriation. Deradicalisation programmes will need to be developed to deal with children such as these.By examining only two cases, it becomes apparent that there will be no comforting blanket government policy of \u201cbringing the children home\u201d if we cannot determine their nationality.\u00a0Islamic State fighters are duplicitous and would be keen to return with children that have been radicalised and who have no connection to the state they are being repatriated to. Such a lack of connection makes further radicalisation easier to achieve.Repatriating minors is not without its complications and risks. The identity of these minors, and thus their nationality, cannot always be determined. Birth certificates may be held on file by their home governments, but for those born within the caliphate, it is not so easy to determine, especially if they have been orphaned.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nMany of the civilians fleeing the last Islamic State group enclave are children from jihadist families, who bear the scars of the ferocious fighting that has raged since December (Photo: AFP/Delil SOULEIMAN)\n                            \n\n                    \n                As highlighted, DNA testing to establish a child\u2019s antecedents is the first option to establish their citizenship, only then can a government decide what to do about repatriation of these children, with or without their mothers. \u00a0However, this could be a lengthy and expensive process and time is not on their side.Dr Rodger Shanahan is a Research Fellow at the Lowy Institute.\u00a0Jennifer Percival is an intern on the West Asia Project at the same\u00a0institute.

That prompted America, backed by its NATO and non-NATO allies, to intervene in Afghanistan the following month with the aim of destroying al Qaeda and dislodging the Taliban regime.The US-led forces quickly dispersed al Qaeda\u2019s leadership and ended Taliban rule, but failed to defeat either group decisively.\u00a0The Taliban and elements of al Qaeda staged a comeback within two years of the US intervention, and have tied down American and allied forces in a low-grade but staggeringly costly insurgency ever since.THE WILL TO WITHDRAWNow, after nearly two decades of fighting, US President Donald Trump desperately wants to disentangle America from a seemingly unwinnable war \u2013 preferably through a political settlement with the Taliban.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nPresident Donald Trump said the United States has the situation in Afghanistan \"under control\" AFP/Nicholas Kamm\n                            \n\n                    \n                Trump\u2019s Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, the Afghan-American Zalmay Khalilzad, has been engaged since September 2018 in shuttle diplomacy, in an eerie parallel with the unsuccessful efforts of then-US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to bring about peace in the Middle East following the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.Khalilzad has just begun his ninth round of negotiations with Taliban representatives in Doha.\u00a0Separately, he has had numerous meetings with the Afghan government and non-governmental leaders, as well as with regional and international actors \u2013 but not Iran, with which the US is locked in a cycle of deepening hostility.READ:\u00a0Commentary: The fight in Syria isn\u2019t just about defeating the Islamic StateHe has focused on four interrelated objectives: A timetable for the exit of all foreign troops currently in Afghanistan; a commitment from the Taliban to prevent hostile acts being launched against the US from Afghan soil; direct negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government, which the Taliban regard as \u201cillegitimate\u201d and a \u201cpuppet\u201d; and a ceasefire across Afghanistan.BREWING COMPLICATIONSBut although Khalilzad may finally manage to reach agreement with the Taliban regarding the first two aims, there is no guarantee that America\u2019s partner in the peace talks will help to realise the remaining two.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad is the US point man for Afghanistan peace talks with the Taliban.

Neither the Ghilzais nor the rival Durrani tribe of former President Hamid Karzai are much trusted by non-Pashtun ethnic groups, who (though themselves divided) collectively form the largest share of Afghanistan\u2019s population.To complicate matters further, all Afghan ethnic groups have extensive cross-border ties with the country\u2019s neighbours.CONDITIONS ON THE GROUNDMeanwhile, IS has loyalty to no one inside Afghanistan.

Otherwise, the consequences will be disastrous.Because of the way the peace process and the situation in Afghanistan have evolved, a hasty foreign-troop withdrawal would lead to a fiasco similar to those generated by the earlier Soviet retreat from the country and by the US withdrawal from Vietnam.To avoid such a catastrophe, the US and its allies need to remain in Afghanistan for at least another decade.But Trump is in a hurry, and thinks that a strong CIA presence in the country will manage to do what Western forces have been unable to achieve.More likely than not, that will prove to be wishful thinking.Amin Saikal, Professor of Political Science at the Australian National University, is the author of Zone of Crisis: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and Iraq, and co-author (with James Piscatori) of Islam Beyond Borders: The Umma in World Politics."},

Do we want to be there forever? Time for others to finally fight,\" he tweeted.But he found little support. The top Republican and Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, Mac Thornberry and Adam Smith respectively, came together Thursday to voice concern, saying a withdrawal would be a \"strategic error\" that would endanger Kurdish allies and empower rivals Russia and Iran.\"ISIS was and still remains a lethal threat to America's security and will seek to inspire threats to the homeland from safe havens around the world,\" they said in a joint statement.The United States will keep up air strikes in Syria so long as troops remain, Pentagon spokeswoman Commander Rebecca Rebarich said, but it was unclear what would happen afterward.PUTIN PRAISES TRUMPFrance and Britain both have small contingents of special forces inside Syria, focused like the US troops on battling the Islamic State group.The US withdrawal will make Russia, which has deployed its air power in support of President Bashar al-Assad, the pre-eminent global power in the conflict.As Trump tweeted that Russia wanted US forces to stay and blamed the \"fake news\" media for reporting otherwise, Putin publicly rejoiced over the pullout order.\"The fact that the US has decided to withdraw its troops is right,\" Putin said during an annual year-end press conference, saying that \"on the whole I agree with the US president\" on the level of damage inflicted on Islamic State.Putin, who has described the fall of the Soviet Union as a historic geopolitical disaster, sees Moscow's longtime ally Syria as a key asset in preserving influence in the Middle East.Iran's Shiite clerical regime has also strongly backed Assad, a secular leader from the heterodox Alawite sect.Turkey opposes Assad and may be emboldened by Trump to attack Kurdish fighters inside Syria, who fought alongside US troops against the Islamic State group.Turkey links the Kurds who dominate the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces to a decades-old insurgency at home, but had been reluctant to strike for fear of setting off a crisis if the United States suffered casualties.Mustefa Bali, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, said the fighters would keep up the battle against Islamic State -\u00a0but that all bets were off if Turkey attacks.WORRIES IN EUROPEBali said the Kurdish forces would keep locked up the Islamic State extremists in their custody - but alleged that Turkey may target prisons to sow chaos once US troops leave.French President Emmanuel Macron's office called the prisoner issue \"extremely important for France\" and urged discussions to avoid \"one of the negative consequences of a hasty retreat.\"The Islamic State movement has claimed credit for a slew of bloody attacks around the world, including the 2015 coordinated assault on Paris, and experts estimate that thousands of sympathizers remain.Meanwhile Germany, which has taken in more than one million refugees stemming in large part from the Syria conflict, questioned Trump's assessment that the threat was over.While fighting has largely subsided in Syria and the Islamic State group holds little territory, a political solution remains elusive in ending the war that has killed more than 360,000 and displaced millions since 2011.The outgoing UN envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, acknowledged on Thursday to the Security Council that a goal would not be met of setting up a committee by the end of the year to write a new Syrian constitution."},

As with US foreign policy, when they sneeze, the entire world can catch a cold.The 2008 Global Financial Crisis was sparked by vulnerabilities in the US and the United Kingdom, but quickly went global. A US-based cyber crisis could easily do the same.This creates an \u201cexternality,\u201d or global commons problem, because US regulators allow risks to build up in the system without adequately considering international implications.LISTEN: That awkward conversation we need to have with Facebook, an episode on The Pulse podcastIt is a problem that cannot be overcome without addressing fundamental questions about the role of the state, privacy, and how US firms can compete globally against China, where the government is using domestic tech companies to collect data on its citizens at an exponential pace.\u00a0And yet many would prefer to avoid them.That\u2019s why there has been fierce pushback against Warren for daring to suggest that even if many services seem to be provided for free, there might still be something wrong.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe rise of social media and Big Tech has generated calls for antitrust action in recent years.

At this point, ideas for regulating Big Tech are just sketches, and of course more serious analysis is warranted.An open, informed discussion that is not squelched by lobbying dollars is an imperative.The debate that Warren has joined is not about whether to establish socialism.

Pyongyang has long said its nuclear weapons aim at deterring a US attack on North Korea. It would be wise to take Kim at his word.While Trump has said that eliminating the North Korean bomb and missile programmes is the summit\u2019s sine qua non, Pyongyang made plain this month that it has other goals, backhanding the idea of trading its nuclear arsenal for an end to economic sanctions or access to Western investment.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementFor now, the US-North Korea summit is still on the schedule. \u201cWe\u2019re moving along and we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Trump said Tuesday. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t happen [in June], maybe it will happen later.\u201d\u00a0Speaking at a media briefing ahead of his meeting with South Korean president Moon Jae-in at the White House, the US president again stressed that denuclearisation \u201cmust take place\u201d.\u00a0He said:I have very strong opinions on the subject.However, Trump\u2019s focus on nuclear weapons \u2013 and his seeming willingness to put US forces on the negotiating table \u2013 is missing the North\u2019s real leverage: Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and firepower within easy striking distance of Seoul.\n    Advertisement\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nNorth Korean soldiers look at the South side at the truce village of Panmunjom in the demilitarised zone on the border between North and South Korea.

He\u2019s not alone in reaching for the chance to put the US presence in Asia in play.His reconciliation with president Xi Jinping after five years of estrangement is ample evidence China sees the opportunity too. Beijing is extending its offshore military reach in order to raise the price of Washington\u2019s strategic access to Asia.A US drawback from Korea would serve the goal well.Kim is focused on the long game. If talks go forward after June, their differences over denuclearising Korea obviously won\u2019t be resolved in a day.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe latest visit by a North Korean delegation comes after Kim Jong Un made two trips over the border to see Xi Jinping.

Pyongyang wants a mutual and phased approach, security guarantees, and a treaty ending the Korean War.Kim has said he isn\u2019t demanding a US troop withdrawal as a condition for denuclearising the peninsula. He doesn\u2019t need to. For the last several years, Trump\u2019s campaign-trail comments about US forces abroad probably couldn\u2019t have opened that door any wider if he\u2019d used talking points drafted in Pyongyang.Trump\u2019s threats to pull back troops or close bases if US allies don\u2019t redo their trade deals or pick up more of the US military tab, of course, still make his domestic supporters cheer.RISKS WILL REMAIN AFTER DENUCLEARISATIONFor Asian audiences, however, the applause lines are undermining US credibility. For them, an effort to reach a nuclear deal with Kim won\u2019t change the risks on the Korean peninsula.How Pyongyang arrays its conventional forces and Korea\u2019s geography show why.North Korea has deployed two-thirds of its million-strong army within 60 miles of Seoul. Along with the manpower, 8,000 artillery systems and 4,000 tanks are dug into a reported 4,000 hardened sites north of the DMZ.\u00a0In addition to conventional munitions, the North\u2019s forces possess hundreds of short- and medium-range missiles as well as fully developed chemical and biological weapons.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA view of artillery fire and landing exercises guided by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u00a0in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang on Feb\u00a021, 2015.

Precision weapons and airpower would take their toll, as would the US ability to transport soldiers and equipment to sustain the allies\u2019 campaign.But even with dated hardware and an army strapped by the North\u2019s sorry economic state, no US commander would underestimate the costs of neutralising its firepower, or the devastation likely from the fight.READ:\u00a0A commentary on more than personal chemistry needed to change North Korea\u2019s old ways.READ:\u00a0A commentary on how Singapore and Southeast Asia can play a key role in the Korean Peninsula thaw.\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bREAD:\u00a0Don't be lured by Kim Jong Un's sweet whispers of peace, a commentary.HOLDING SEOUL HOSTAGEA strictly military calculus also misses the strategic point. Even without nuclear weapons, the North Korean army holds Seoul hostage.With the vast majority, the North\u2019s nearly 14,000 long-range guns and rockets near the DMZ, Seoul\u2019s metropolitan area is well within range of the forward-deployed artillery.American and South Korean analysts also believe that North Korean commanders are provisioned to attack without notice, handicapping civil defense leaders as well as military commanders who would have only minutes of warning time to prepare.With half of all South Koreans living in Seoul, the challenge of protecting its 25 million residents is obvious. So, too, are the risks to the economy.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nPeople watch a TV broadcast of a news report on North Korea's ballistic missile test, at a railway station in Seoul, South Korea, on Jul\u00a04, 2017.

South Korea produces 40 per cent of the world\u2019s liquid crystal displays, 17 per cent of the world\u2019s semiconductors and 64 per cent of its memory chips; the impact on global markets if Samsung, SK Holdings or other production plants are damaged isn\u2019t hard to imagine.If Kim wants to talk about the 28,500 US troops in South Korea next month, the right place for Trump to begin is the conventional threat faced by the American soldiers and their South Korean counterparts.Nearly 20 years ago, the treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe laid out practical steps that reduced the risk of conflict created by similarly forward-deployed NATO and Warsaw Pact forces.A focus on Kim\u2019s nuclear programme shouldn\u2019t be an impediment to applying its model. In Europe, conventional arms talks unfolded in parallel with strategic arms negotiations.Trump has an opportunity to put the North\u2019s conventional threat on the agenda.

But if Washington wanted to talk, \"we will keep the door open\"."},

Today, it\u2019s much easier for someone to both create the spectacle of horrific violence and distribute it widely by themselves.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementIn an era of social media, which is driven in large part by spectacle, we all have a role to play in ensuring that terrorists aren\u2019t rewarded for their crimes with our clicks.PERFORMANCE CRIME IS ABOUT NOTORIETYThere is a tragic and recent history of performance crime videos that use live-streaming and social media video services as part of their tactics.In 2017, for example, the sickening murder video of an elderly man in Ohio was uploaded to Facebook, and the torture of a man with disabilities in Chicago was live-streamed. In 2015, the murder of two journalists was simultaneously broadcast on-air, and live-streamed.\n    AdvertisementAmerican journalist Gideon Lichfield wrote of the 2015 incident, that the killer:\u00a0didn\u2019t just want to commit murder \u2013 he wanted the reward of attention, for having done it.Performance crimes can be distinguished from the way traditional terror attacks and propaganda work, such as the hyper-violent videos spread by the Islamic State\u00a0in 2014.Typical propaganda media that feature violence use a dramatic spectacle to raise attention and communicate the group\u2019s message. But the perpetrators of performance crimes often don\u2019t have a clear ideological message to convey.READ:\u00a0Christchurch attack another clear sign extremists of all persuasions are a major threat to the world, a commentary\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nMourners carry the first coffin of the Christchurch mosques massacre victim at Memorial Park Cemetery during the funeral ceremony in Christchurch on Mar\u00a020, 2019.

He shot the stranger point-blank on video. Vester Flanagan\u2019s appalling murder of two journalists seems to have been motivated by his anger at being fired from the same network.The Christchurch attack was a brutal, planned mass murder of Muslims in New Zealand, but we don\u2019t yet know whether it was about communicating the ideology of a specific group.Even though it\u2019s easy to identify explicit references to white supremacist ideas, the document is also strewn with confusing and inexplicable internet meme references and red herrings. These could be regarded as trolling attempts to bait the public into interrogating his claims, and magnifying the attention paid to the perpetrator and his gruesome killings.HOW WE SHOULD RESPONDWhile many questions remain about the attack itself, we need to consider how best to respond to performance crime videos.\u00a0Since 2012, many academics and journalists have argued that media coverage of mass violence should be limited to prevent the reward of attention from potentially driving further attacks.That debate has continued following the tragic events in New Zealand. Journalism lecturer Glynn Greensmith argued that our responsibility may well be to limit the distribution of the Christchurch shooting video and manifesto as much as possible.It seems that, in this case, social media and news platforms have been more mindful about removing the footage, and refusing to rebroadcast it. The video was taken down within 20 minutes by Facebook, which said that in the first 24 hours it removed 1.5 million videos of the attack globally.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nFacebook said it halted a livestream of the killing spree in New Zealand but the video, which reportedly lasted 17 minutes, was captured and used on other internet platforms. (Photo: AFP/Christophe Simon)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Telecommunication service Vodafone moved quickly to block New Zealand users from access to sites that would be likely to distribute the video.The video is likely to be declared objectionable material, according to New Zealand\u2019s Department of Internal Affairs, which means it is illegal to possess. Many are calling on the public not to share it online.'DISTANT TRAUMA'Yet the video still exists, dispersed throughout the internet. It may be removed from official sites, but its online presence is maintained via re-uploads and file-sharing sites.\u00a0Screenshots of the videos, which frequently appear in news reports, also inherit symbolic and traumatic significance when they serve as visual reminders of the distressing event.Watching images like these has the potential to provoke vicarious trauma in viewers. Studies since the September 11 attacks suggest that \u201cdistant trauma\u201d can be linked to multiple viewings of distressing media images.While the savage violence of the event is distressing in its own right, this additional potential to traumatise people who simply watch the video is something that also plays into the aims of those committing performance crimes in the name of terror.REWARDING THE SPECTACLEPlatforms like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube are powered by a framework that encourages, rewards and creates performance. People who post cat videos cater to this appetite for entertainment, but so do criminals.According to British criminologist Majid Yar, the new media environment has created different genres of performance crime. The performances have increased in intensity, and criminality \u2013 from so-called \u201chappy slapping\u201d videos circulated among adolescents, to violent sexual assault videos.\u00a0READ:\u00a0BIGBANG\u2019s Seungri\u2019s sex scandal and the end of K-pop\u2019s innocence, a commentaryThe recent attack is a terrifying continuation of this trend, which is predicated on a kind of exhibitionism and desire to be identified as the performer of the violence.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA student leaving a tribute at the memorial wall in Canterbury University.

Of course, I don\u2019t mean that the perpetrators are not responsible or accountable for their actions.\u00a0Rather, performance crime represents a different type of activity specific to the technology and social phenomenon of social media \u2013 the accidental dark side of live-streaming services.Would the alleged perpetrator of this terrorist act in Christchurch still have committed it without the capacity to live-stream? We don\u2019t know.But as Majid Yar suggests, rather than concerning ourselves with old arguments about whether media violence can cause criminal behaviour, we should focus on how the techniques and reward systems we use to represent ourselves to online audiences are in fact a central component of these attacks.We may hope that social media companies will get better at filtering out violent content, but until they do we should reflect on our own behaviour online.\u00a0As we like and share content of all kinds on social platforms, let\u2019s consider how our activities could contribute to an overall spectacle society that inspires future perpetrator-produced videos of performance crime \u2013 and act accordingly.Stuart M Bender is a Early Career Research Fellow (Digital aesthetics of violence) at\u00a0Curtin University.

Since joining the World Trade Organisation in 2001, China has reaped the benefits of the global trading and investment system, while failing to meet its obligations and free riding on its rules.According to the US, China has gained an unfair advantage through intellectual-property theft, forced technology transfers, subsidies for domestic firms, and other instruments of state capitalism.For their part, the Chinese suspect that the US\u2019s real goal is to prevent them from rising any further or projecting legitimate power and influence abroad.\n    AdvertisementREAD:\u00a0Xi Jinping is readying China for a long, brutal trade war, a commentaryIn their view, it is only reasonable that the world\u2019s second-largest economy (by GDP) would seek to expand its presence on the world stage.

Whereas the Soviet Union was a declining power with a failing economic model, China will soon become the world\u2019s largest economy, and will continue to grow from there.Moreover, the US and the Soviet Union traded very little with each other, whereas China is fully integrated in the global trading and investment system, and deeply intertwined with the US, in particular.A full-scale cold war thus could trigger a new stage of de-globalisation, or at least a division of the global economy into two incompatible economic blocs.In either scenario, trade in goods, services, capital, labour, technology, and data would be severely restricted, and the digital realm would become a \u201csplinternet,\u201d wherein Western and Chinese nodes would not connect to one another.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe logo of Huawei, which is facing an effective ban in the United States, is seen at a retail store in Beijing.

After all, many US allies now do more business (in terms of trade and investment) with China than they do with America.Yet in a future economy where China and the US separately control access to crucial technologies such as AI and 5G, the middle ground will most likely become uninhabitable. Everyone will have to choose, and the world may well enter a long process of de-globalisation.Whatever happens, the Sino-American relationship will be the key geopolitical issue of this century. Some degree of rivalry is inevitable. But, ideally, both sides would manage it constructively, allowing for cooperation on some issues and healthy competition on others.In effect, China and the US would create a new international order, based on the recognition that the (inevitably) rising new power should be granted a role in shaping global rules and institutions.If the relationship is mismanaged \u2013 with the US trying to derail China\u2019s development and contain its rise, and China aggressively projecting its power in Asia and around the world \u2013 a full-scale cold war will ensue, and a hot one (or a series of proxy wars) cannot be ruled out.In the twenty-first century, the Thucydides Trap would swallow not just the US and China, but the entire world.Nouriel Roubini is CEO of Roubini Macro Associates and Professor of Economics at the Stern School of Business, NYU."},

Ncell and Flowminder won the Global Mobile Award for humanitarian aid collaboration in 2016.As this illustration shows, tools and data if placed in government hands can have huge positive impact.

A commentaryAnd yet, Assad, like the French Bourbons, seems to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing during his 18 years in power, and is unlikely to consolidate his victory by introducing the federalised, decentralised structures needed to govern Syria effectively.MEANWHILE, IS THRIVESUS policy in Syria, the policy that Trump campaigned against and has now officially abandoned, has long rested on two pillars: Stability in Iraq and the defeat of IS.\u00a0Under President Barack Obama, and then briefly under Trump, US forces worked with local fighters to bring IS to heel. But, contrary to Trump\u2019s claims, IS is neither defeated nor dead; absent viable institutions and stable political arrangements in Syria, the group is likely to return in some form.Rather than acting unilaterally, as he apparently did, Trump should have been asking his foreign policy team for clarification on a number of thorny questions.\u00a0What endgame should the US be seeking in Syria? Given Assad\u2019s support from Russia, Iran, and Turkey (whose interests in Syria are hardly trivial), how likely is his departure?\u00a0What political solutions are possible? Is an election feasible or desirable in a context devoid of functioning institutions?But even posing these simple questions \u2013 which admittedly have no easy answers \u2013 seemed beyond Trump\u2019s ability and range of experience. Instead of asking anything, Trump chose to declare victory and leave.\u00a0A FAMILIAR PATTERNThat decision, and the expected withdrawal from Afghanistan and perhaps elsewhere, fits a familiar pattern: America\u2019s engagements with the world are too often guided by a premature belief that the objective has been achieved.\u00a0READ: Getting the US out of Middle East purgatory, a commentary\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA vehicle drives past a billboard bearing the logo of the Islamic State group in Syria's Deir Ezzor province on Sep\u00a024, 2017.

So while it is important to dry your hands properly wherever you are, paper towels are always the preferred option if you are in hospital as a patient or a visitor \u2013 or a member of staff.As part of our review, we also looked at government policy on hand drying and found that disposable paper towels are recognised as being the quickest and most effective way of removing residual moisture that may allow for the transmission of microorganisms.\u00a0This is good to know given the current concerns around the spread of the coronavirus.In this sense, our research serves as a timely reminder that proper and effective hand drying is integral to hand hygiene whether you\u2019re in a hospital, doctor\u2019s surgery or just in the office.BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the novel coronavirus\u00a0and its developmentsDownload\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegramJohn Gammon is Deputy Head of the College of Human and Health Sciences, Swansea University.

Ten of his staff were killed or injured.\"Today, most of them did not show up. When we contacted them, they said they fear for their lives.\"NO SECURITYSaturday's attack exposes the vulnerability of the wedding halls.\n    AdvertisementIn a city where bombs go off almost daily and crime is rampant, Kabul weddings typically don't have any security measures at all, and the halls themselves often have few emergency exits.Couples frequently invite more than 1,000 guests, and gate crashers often wander in off the street.Unless VIPs are present, it is considered insulting to frisk guests, and strangers blend in easily with the crowds of friends and relatives.\"We will take extra security measures, but it will be hard to stop a bomber among hundreds of guests coming to a wedding party,\" Sultani said.Sharif, the manager of another Kabul wedding hall who only gave one name, said his business was already suffering, with no new couples calling to book the venue since the attack.\"We are supposed to provide a joyful and safe environment for people to celebrate the start of their new life together, but following the horrific attack last night, everything will change,\" he told AFP.\"I don't think people will trust us or the government for their security any more.\"The attack underscores both the inadequacy of Afghanistan's security forces and the scale of the challenge they face in a city that sees frequent attacks by IS, the Taliban, criminals and other groups.Dawood Hotak, a 26-year-old engaged student, blamed local police and said he now plans to get married at home instead of at a wedding hall.\"People should be searched before entering the wedding halls,\" he told AFP.\"If there would have been body searches, I am sure the attack would have been prevented.\"Fellow student Ahmad Jawed, 24, was also angry at the authorities and lamented the lack of security.\"How come a wedding hall does not get attacked when there is VIP party or ceremony?\" he said.\"The security institutions fail to provide security to ordinary Afghans.\"'NO MORE SAFE PLACES'Kabul weddings pump millions of dollars into the local economy, with the events typically a costly affair.A fancy wedding with all the trimmings - including singers, live music and vast plates of food - can cost US$15,000 or more, an absolute fortune in one of the world's poorest countries.Young grooms often splash out their life savings or take on debt for a night of celebration.A few years ago, Afghan politicians passed legislation to cap wedding costs and limit the number of guests to 500, but this has been roundly ignored.Last November, a suicide bomber hit the Uranus Wedding Palace in the capital as religious scholars gathered, killing at least 55, but Saturday's attack is thought to be the first of its kind against a Kabul wedding in full swing.\"There are no more safe places in Kabul,\" the Uranus's manager Haji Ghulam Sediq told AFP.\"It is not just the employees and the guests, I myself am fearful.\""},

A smaller number of carriers will operate reduced timetables \u2013 possibly with social-distancing measures, such as leaving middle seats empty, which would significantly increase costs.Emirates has already introduced pre-boarding blood tests; AirAsia recently unveiled new cabin-crew uniforms consisting of masks, visors and protective suits.

Four reasons why business travel will bounce back from the COVID-19 slumpSo non-flying trips will surely boom, domestically or to nearby countries accessible by car or boat, leaving holidays by air to become more of a special event: Rarer, longer and more considered.As anxieties about infection persist, the draw of the big, crowded honeypots (St Peter\u2019s Square, say, or the alleyways of Dubrovnik) may begin to fade.Instead, visitors might prefer to spread out into lesser-visited parts \u2013 a long-held, if little-realised strategy for dealing with overtourism.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nPeople are seen in coffee shop in Dubrovnik, Croatia, August 2, 2018.

I suspect it will find a clientele much more prepared to abandon old habits \u2013 flying for example, and joining crowds \u2013 and readier to adopt new ones to protect all-too-fragile life.\u201dSHORTENED SUPPLY CHAINSThe industry\u2019s supply chains could be shortened, too.At present, a typical adventure holiday, for example, might be booked with a travel agent who takes a commission and then passes the booking on to a specialist tour operator, who passes it to a destination management company, which then subcontracts to an actual guide.A third of the cost of the holiday or more might never leave the traveller\u2019s home country.READ: Commentary: The Philippines, home of many beautiful destinations \u2013 and the scourge of mass tourismREAD: Commentary: Instagram has turned travel into must-share social occasionsMuch of the sales pitch for this traditional model is that it provides security, but the pandemic has blown a hole in those assurances.While some operators are playing it scrupulously by the book, many are refusing to give refunds, offering only credit notes that may be convertible to cash at a later date.The reason is understandable \u2013 the money has already disappeared down the supply chain \u2013 but the effect on public trust could be long-lasting.The alternative is the new generation of online platforms that connect the traveller direct with an operator in the destination.Companies such as Much Better Adventures and TravelLocal were already growing strongly as awareness of responsible travel spread, and thanks to a more general digital drift, but the trend could now be accelerated.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n(Photo: Unsplash)\n                            \n\n                    \n                \u201cPeople are thinking, if I am going to travel somewhere, I should really make it count \u2013 meeting local people, learning something, travelling in a meaningful way and helping the local economy as much as possible,\u201d says Huw Owen, co-founder of TravelLocal.Already, younger travellers, brought up in the world of online connections, have proved more willing to book direct, while older travellers have continued to support the conventional model.Sadly, that baby-boom generation, who invented backpacking in their youth and have spent their retirement exploring, are likely to be locked down the longest.Meanwhile, younger travellers \u2013 raised with a more acute awareness of environmental threats and the need for responsible travel \u2013 might find themselves the newly dominant pioneers in a rebooted industry.BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the\u00a0coronavirus outbreak and its developmentsDownload\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegram"},

It enjoys huge support from the Chinese population, who see the US\u2019 move as an effort to keep China down in reaction to the country\u2019s growing economic heft and emergence as a technological power.Sales of smartphones by Huawei have surpassed Apple since 2017, and each iteration of its smartphone have made leaps in technology, especially in camera technology.For the Chinese, to purchase a Huawei no longer symbolises a value-for-money proposition but a representation of China\u2019s technological success and coming-of-age story.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nHuawei P30 handset is displayed in a phone shop at a shopping centre in Bangkok, Thailand May 22, 2019.

The EMUI 9 user interface, rolled out on older devices including the Huawei Mate 9 and P10 can serve as a substitute to Android-based systems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nScreengrab from a video of the launch of Huawei's Mate 9.

THE TONE OF THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIPStill, most Huawei smartphone users in China understand that their \u201cmade-in-China\u201d smartphones will experience some intermittent issues during this period as the trade war brews but accept some temporary discomfort.It is unlikely that they will switch to a Samsung or Apple device over the next few months.But many are likely to direct their impatience at the US, where concerns that such moves aimed squarely at Huawei may have been motivated by lobbying from Silicon Valley giants like Apple.

Washington wants Pyongyang to stop its recent advances in missile and warhead technology that could endanger the entire continental United States.North Korea wants to be sure it has the military clout to deter the United States from taking military action against it, the primary reason it was pushing ahead so aggressively with its test programme.And South Korea \u2013 particularly under President Moon \u2013 has made it a primary national security priority to avoiding any outbreak of hostilities that would devastate the Korean peninsula.On that front, the current situation \u2013 and particularly the upcoming programme of talks \u2013 actually suits all sides.For North Korea, the diplomatic process brokered by the South \u2013 starting with the Winter Olympics, now moving towards the Kim-Trump meeting in Singapore \u2013 gave a ready excuse to halt an aggressive \u2013 but also increasingly provocative \u2013 weapons testing programme.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nPyeongchang, South Korea; South Korea president Moon Jae-in at the short track speed skating men's 1,000m final A during the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Winter Games at Gangneung Ice Arena.

All sides have a vested interest in keeping the diplomatic process going, but none really want to give up much while they do so.Anything that allows delay, therefore, can almost be seen as a positive \u2013 providing it doesn\u2019t cause such great anger on any side that matters start to escalate dramatically again.That makes it possible neither side would lose much sleep should the Singapore talks have to be delayed. The most likely scenario, however, remains the status quo continuing on the peninsula, even as all sides pull out all the stops to maintain the illusion of a forward-moving diplomatic process.And that, perhaps, is South Korean President Moon\u2019s greatest victory. As long as parties are talking, South Korea is staving off disaster.That might have to be enough for everyone, at least for now.Peter Apps is executive director at the Project for Study of the 21st Century and Reuters\u2019 global affairs columnist."},

Globalisation is under siege. Tensions between the US and China are growing. Like everyone else, we in Singapore are anxious. We wonder what the future holds, and how countries can collectively find a way forward to maintain peace and prosperity in the world.What can the history of Southeast Asia tell us about avoiding upheavals and disasters in our path ahead? This year, Singapore is commemorating our Bicentennial. 200 years ago, Stamford Raffles, an Englishman, landed in Singapore and founded a trading post here. The Dutch had already colonised the Dutch East Indies, so the British were actually latecomers to Southeast Asia. Raffles was Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen, on the west coast of Sumatra. He saw the trade potential of the region, and decided to look for a new outpost for the British East India Company along the Straits of Malacca. He chose Singapore, and that changed our destiny.\n    AdvertisementThe Dutch protested Raffles\u2019 action furiously, but in vain. To preserve their monopoly, the Dutch had either prohibited foreign ships from operating in their ports, or imposed high tariffs. Raffles took a different approach. He set up Singapore as a free port. Trade boomed, and the settlement prospered. The more open approach of the British delivered superior results.Over the next century, Southeast Asia was divided between the British, Dutch, Spanish, French, and later the Americans. Their rivalry was intense. No single colonial power dominated the whole region.In the 20th century, the interests of big powers continued to intersect in Southeast Asia. In 1941, Imperial Japan invaded French Indochina. The US retaliated with an oil embargo on Japan. This was the immediate trigger for the Pacific War. On the same day that Japan bombed Pearl Harbour, they also attacked Malaya and Singapore. There followed for us the Japanese Occupation: three years and eight months of oppression, fear, and misery.During the Cold War, Southeast Asia was again on the frontline. The region was split between communist and non-communist states. Vietnam became the battlefield for a proxy war between the two camps. Meanwhile, China supported communist insurgencies and promoted armed revolution in the non-communist countries, including Malaysia and Singapore.This was the backdrop when the five non-communist countries in Southeast Asia - Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines\u00a0and Thailand - came together to form ASEAN. It was a remarkable act of statesmanship. Several of the partners had a recent history of conflict with one another, and the wounds had yet to heal fully. But with ASEAN, the five countries eschewed conflict, and took the path of dialogue, cooperation and friendship. We integrated into the world economy, linked up with advanced countries, and thrived. Meanwhile, the communist countries in Indochina were held back for decades by successive wars and the rigidity of their command economies.After the Cold War ended, the US became the sole superpower. Southeast Asia entered a new phase. The Indochinese wars finally ended, and the communist countries opened up. Earlier, Vietnam had invaded Cambodia, thus posing a serious threat to its non-communist neighbours. But now Vietnam joined ASEAN, together with Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. It was a case of beating swords into ploughshares.Over the next decades, Southeast Asia benefited from a favourable external environment. The US was the dominant power in the Asia Pacific, and a stabilising security presence. International trade was expanding rapidly. Trade barriers came down, often led by the US. The ASEAN economies prospered through export-led growth and foreign investments. International frameworks like the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) established rules, managed conflict, balanced competing interests, and fostered cooperation between countries big and small. Initially China played only a minor economic role, but as its economy took off, it became a growing partner of the ASEAN countries, and a major participant in regional affairs.US-China relationsI recount this history to show that Southeast Asia is no stranger to the great game of nations, and to offer some historical perspective to the current strategic situation. The US-China bilateral relationship is the most important in the world today. How the two work out their tensions and frictions will define the international environment for decades\u00a0to come.The relationship has already altered significantly. China has totally changed since it started opening up 40\u00a0years ago. Its GDP per capita has grown by more than 25 times in real terms. China is now the second largest economy in the world.On many counts, China\u2019s growth is a tremendous boon, both for itself and the world. China has substantially transformed its backward, centrally-planned economy into a middle-income, market-driven one, even though it is still far from being a full market economy. More than 850 million Chinese people have been lifted out of poverty, an achievement unprecedented in human history.China\u2019s development and success has benefited the world too. China has become a massive production and manufacturing base, lowering costs for the world\u2019s producers, first for labour-intensive goods, and now increasingly for high value and technology-intensive production. It is also a huge market, importing everything from commodities and electronic components to aircraft and fine wines. On the consumer side, billions of people worldwide buy all manner of products, from Barbie dolls and basketballs to drones and mobile phones, made in China, though often incorporating foreign components and technology.Imagine, conversely, that China had remained closed and undeveloped. A failing China would have exported many problems to the world, quite possibly still including armed revolution. Its huge population would have been resentful and restless at being left behind by other countries. A generation ago, when China was still poor, Deng Xiaoping was asked by US President Jimmy Carter to allow more people to emigrate. He answered: \u201cWell, Mr President, how many Chinese nationals do you want? Ten million? Twenty million? Thirty million?\u201dChina\u2019s success has enabled the world to avoid this disastrous outcome. At the same time, China\u2019s growth has shifted the strategic balance and the economic centre of gravity of the world, and the shift continues.Both China and the rest of the world have to adapt to this new reality. China has to recognise that it is in a totally new situation created by its own success. It can no longer expect to be treated the same way as in the past when it was much smaller and weaker. China may still be decades away from becoming a fully developed advanced country, but it cannot wait decades before taking on larger responsibilities.Having gained much from the international system, China now has a substantial stake in upholding it, and making it work for the global community. Chinese leaders have spoken up strongly in support of globalisation and a rules-based international order. China must now convince other countries through its actions that it does not take a transactional and mercantilist approach, but rather an enlightened and inclusive view of its long term interests.For example, when China joined the WTO in 2001, its merchandise trade accounted for only 4.0% of world trade. Since then China\u2019s share has almost tripled, to 11.8%. This is why the trade arrangements and concessions that China negotiated when it joined the WTO are no longer politically wearable for other countries. It is in China\u2019s own interest to prevent the international framework of trade from breaking down, and to implement timely changes that bring about greater reciprocity and parity with its trading partners, and that are more consistent with present day China\u2019s more advanced state of development.Similarly, in security, now that China is a major power with the second largest defence budget in the world, its words and actions are seen differently. To protect its territories and trade routes, it is natural that China would want to develop modern and capable armed forces, and aspire to become not just a continental power but also a maritime power. At the same time, to grow its international influence beyond hard power,\u00a0China needs to wield this strength with restraint and legitimacy.Frictions will arise between China and other countries from time to time. The overlapping maritime claims in the South China Sea are an example. China should resolve these disputes peacefully, in accordance with international law, including UNCLOS. It should do so through diplomacy and compromise rather than force or the threat of force, while giving weight to the core interests and rights of other countries. Then over time it will build its reputation as a responsible and benevolent power that need not be feared. Instead China will be respected as a power that can be relied on to support a stable and peaceful region. In the long term, this will allow China to continue to benefit from a conducive and friendly international environment, and enhance its influence and standing in the world.The rest of the world too has to adjust to a larger role for China. Countries have to accept that China will continue to grow and strengthen, and that it is neither possible nor wise for them to prevent this from happening. China will have its own legitimate interests and ambitions, including to develop indigenously advanced technologies like infocomms and artificial intelligence. As a major stakeholder in the international system, China should be encouraged to play commensurate and constructive roles in supranational institutions like the IMF, World Bank, and WTO. If China cannot do so, it will create its own alternatives.The US, being the preeminent power, has the most difficult adjustment to make. But however difficult the task, it is well worth the US forging a new understanding that will integrate China\u2019s aspirations within the current system of rules and norms. New international rules need to be made in many areas, including trade and intellectual property, cybersecurity and social media. China will expect a say in this process, because it sees the present rules as having been created in the past without its participation. This is a reasonable expectation.The bottomline is that the US and China need to work together, and with other countries too, to bring the global system up to date, and to not upend the system. To succeed in this, each must understand the other\u2019s point of view, and reconcile each other\u2019s interests.Meanwhile, stresses and strains have built up between the two over multiple issues including cyber-espionage, 5G technology, freedom of navigation, human rights, and especially trade, where the two countries have reached an impasse.If both sides treat their trade dispute purely on its own merits, I have no doubt their trade negotiators will be able to resolve it. But if either side uses trade rules to keep the other down, or one side comes to the conclusion that the other is trying to do this, then the dispute will not be resolved, and the consequences will be far graver than a loss of GDP. The broader bilateral relationship will be contaminated. Other areas will inevitably be affected, including investments, technology, and people-to-people relations. Every action taken by one side will be seen as a direct challenge to the other, and will elicit a counter-action. We will all be headed for a more divided and troubled world.Hardening of attitudes in the US and ChinaWorryingly, this is starting to happen. Attitudes on both sides have been hardening. The US National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy documents describe China as a \u201crevisionist power\u201d and America\u2019s \u201cstrategic competitor\u201d. The recent Presidential Executive Order on securing the information and communications technology and services supply chain, states that it is aimed at \u201cforeign adversaries\u201d. It stopped just short of naming any particular country, but made quite clear what actions the US intends to take.There is a growing bipartisan consensus in the US: that China has taken advantage of the US for far too long; that China has overtaken, or will soon overtake, the US in areas of advanced technology, such as artificial intelligence and some aspects of military technology, through underhand means; that instead of opening up and becoming more like the US, China has regressed in terms of political openness, and hence represents a challenge to American values and leadership.Americans now talk openly of containing China, and to do so soon before it is too late, the way they used to talk about the USSR and the Soviet bloc. This negative view of China has permeated the US establishment. It is not confined to the White House or the Administration, but is shared widely by Congress, the military, the media, academics and NGOs too. Those inclined to a more positive view of China have been marginalised.Even US business sentiment towards China has soured. American businesses used to be the strongest supporters of China, because they benefited directly from China\u2019s growth and economic opportunities. They had strongly advocated China\u2019s accession to the WTO. When protectionist or nativist sentiments built up in the US, they were a balancing voice that counselled good relations with China.Now, that goodwill has all but evaporated. US businesses feel let down that China has not adjusted its policies on trade and investments, and in fact systematically disadvantages foreign businesses operating in China, while Chinese businesses operate uninhibited in the US. They want greater access to the China market, and not just to use China for their global supply chains. This loss of goodwill on the part of an important constituency is a serious problem for China, which the Chinese have not fully appreciated or dealt with.In China, views are hardening too. There are those who see the US as trying to thwart China\u2019s legitimate ambitions -\u00a0convinced that no matter what they do or concede on individual issues, the US will never be satisfied. They are alarmed by talk of a \u201cclash of civilisations\u201d between the US and China. They reject what they see as efforts by the US to impose its political system and values on China.This is coupled with a strong vein of nationalist fervour. Chinese television is rebroadcasting old movies of the Korean War, which is known in Chinese as \u6297\u7f8e\u63f4\u671d\u6218\u4e89 -\u00a0the war to resist America and assist North Korea. There is even a \u201cUS trade war song\u201d circulating on the internet, based on a musical track from a popular 1960s war movie about fighting the Japanese in the Sino-Japanese War! Hardly anyone in China, whether in government, academia or the media, can be found who is prepared to speak up for a more positive and benign interpretation of the US\u2019 intent.The fundamental problem between the US and China is a mutual lack of strategic trust. This bodes ill for any compromise or peaceful accommodation. But to go down the present path would be a serious mistake on both sides. There is no strategic inevitability about a US-China face-off. But at the same time, if such a face-off does happen, it will be nothing like the Cold War.First, there is no irreconcilable ideological divide between the US and China. China may be communist in political structure, but it has adopted market principles in many areas. The Soviets sought to overturn the world order. But China has benefited from, and by and large worked within, the framework of existing multilateral institutions. During the Cold War, the Communist bloc sought to export Communism to the world. But China today is not attempting to turn other countries Communist. Indeed, it is often criticised for being too willing to do business with countries and leaders regardless of their reputation or standing, citing non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.Second, China has extensive economic and trade links with the rest of the world. It is a major node in the world economy, unlike the USSR, whose economic links outside the Soviet bloc were negligible. In fact, all of the US\u2019 allies in Asia, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand and Australia, as well as many of its friends and partners, including Singapore, have China as their largest trading partner.\u00a0They all hope that the US and China will resolve their differences. They want to be friends with both: to nurture security and economic ties with the US, as they grow their business links with China. In a new Cold War, there can be no clear division between friend and foe. Nor is it possible to create NATO or Warsaw Pact equivalents with a hard line drawn through Asia, or down the middle of the Pacific Ocean.On the other hand, if there is indeed a conflict between the US and China, where will it end? The Cold War ended with the total collapse of the sclerotic planned economies of the Soviet Union and its allies, under the pressure of enormous defence spending.\u00a0Even then, it took 40 years. It is highly improbable that the vigorous Chinese economy will collapse in the same way.China cannot take down the US either. The US is still by far the strongest country in the world. Its economy remains the most innovative and powerful, and its military capabilities and spending far exceed anyone else's. Americans worry about China catching up with the US, but although China may be abreast or even ahead in some fields, it will be many years before China can equal the US. And contrary to what some people in China think, the US is not a declining power, nor is it withdrawing from the world. In fact, the US has made clear its intention to compete robustly, though in a different mode than before.Even short of outright conflict, a prolonged period of tension and uncertainty will be extremely damaging. Many serious international problems like the Korean situation, nuclear non-proliferation, and climate change cannot be tackled without the full participation of the US and China, together with other countries. In economic terms the loss will be not just a percentage point or two of world GDP, but the huge benefits of globalised markets and production chains, and the sharing of knowledge and breakthroughs that enable all countries to progress faster together.We should therefore do our utmost to avoid going down the path of conflict, and causing enmity on both sides that will last for generations. Of course, it is the duty of security and defence establishments to think the unthinkable, and plan for worst case scenarios. But it is the responsibility of political leaders to find solutions to head off these extreme outcomes.This is hard, because both sides have leaders facing powerful domestic pressures. In the US, the political mood is deeply divided and disgruntled. Large segments of American society have lost confidence in globalisation and multilateralism. According to a Pew survey last year, nearly half of all Americans have an unfavourable opinion of China. As the presidential elections approach, these attitudes will surely deepen, because neither the Republicans nor the Democrats will want to risk being accused of being \u2018soft\u2019 on China. Regardless whether President Trump is re-elected, or another Republican or Democrat wins, these sentiments will not go away.China may not have US-style presidential elections, but their leaders face strong internal pressures too. In fact, the orientation of the Chinese leadership is primarily domestic. They know they have major issues to deal with at home. These include unevenly distributed growth, significant rural poverty, an ageing population, and rising expectations for a better quality of life.Both sides are sensitive about being perceived as weak. Out of political necessity, the US wants to show that it has come out ahead in any deal. On the other side, because of China\u2019s long history with the West, its leaders cannot afford to appear to succumb to Western pressure to accept an \u201cunequal\u201d treaty. Just a few weeks ago, China commemorated the centennial of the May 4 movement. In 1919, at the Versailles Peace Conference, a feeble China was forced to accept the decisions of the big powers. China was on the winning side, but the settlement went against their interests.\u00a0This caused Peking University students to demonstrate in protest, launching a nationalist movement to modernise and revive the country. This was a seminal moment in modern Chinese history.This zero-sum dynamic makes it very hard to construct an agreement that is politically acceptable to both parties. But ultimately it is in the interests of both the US and China to reach such an accommodation, and to persuade their domestic publics to accept it. They both need to keep their relationship steady, so that both can focus on their respective pressing domestic priorities, and not be distracted by troubled relations with the other.MultilateralismWhat can other countries do collectively, to stem the growing hostility and instability? Small states like Singapore can do little to influence the big powers, but we are not entirely without agency.There are many opportunities for smaller countries to work together to deepen economic cooperation, strengthen regional integration, and build up multilateral institutions. This way, we can strengthen our influence as a group, and advance a collective position on issues that matter to us, be it trade, security or technology.Our multilateral institutions today are far from perfect. The WTO is one of the major institutions in the post-war global order, but now it is almost paralysed, and urgently needs reform. Multilateral global deals like the Uruguay Round are no longer practical, when agreement requires a full consensus among 164 member countries of hugely diverse interests and philosophies. Furthermore, the WTO was designed for an agricultural and manufacturing-based world economy, but the world has moved on to services and now increasingly digital and intellectual property, which need much more complicated rules.The US has lost faith in the WTO. It often acts unilaterally, imposing tariffs and trade sanctions outside WTO rules. It prefers negotiating bilateral deals one on one against smaller countries in tests of strength. It gives more weight to the US\u2019 direct benefits in the disputes at hand, than to its broader interests in upholding the multilateral system. This has caused concern to many of the US\u2019 friends and allies.Singapore cannot afford to adopt the same point of view. Being small, we are naturally disadvantaged in bilateral negotiations. We need to reform and strengthen multilateral institutions, not cripple or block them. More fundamentally, confining ourselves to a bilateral approach means forgoing win-win opportunities which come from countries working together with more partners. We need to build a broader regional and international architecture of cooperation. When groups of countries deepen their economic cooperation, they will enhance not just their shared prosperity but also their collective security. With more stake in one another\u2019s success, they will have greater incentive to uphold a conducive and peaceful international order. This will benefit many countries big and small.Thus, short of universal trade agreements, we should at least strive for regional or pluri-lateral arrangements. This may be a second best solution, but it is a practical way to incrementally build support for lower trade barriers and higher standards, which can then be adopted by other countries.This was the rationale behind the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The US originally came on board the TPP because it saw the strategic benefits, although it ultimately withdrew. Fortunately, the remaining 11 members were able to preserve nearly all that had been negotiated, and so the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is now in force.I am glad that more countries have expressed interest to join the CPTPP, including South Korea, Thailand and the UK. China is also watching the CPTPP carefully. They are not ready to join now, but I hope that they will seriously consider doing so sometime in the future. Similarly, I hope one day it will become politically possible for a US administration to rethink the US\u2019 position, and recognise that it stands to gain, economically and strategically, from becoming a member of the partnership that it played such a leading role in designing.Meanwhile, countries in the Asia Pacific are working on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). The RCEP has a different footprint from the CPTPP. It covers all the key countries on the western side of the Pacific, including Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia, and also importantly India, Australia and New Zealand. This inclusive configuration minimises the risk of the RCEP being misperceived as a bloc that excludes the US and its friends. With such a wide range of participants, RCEP standards are naturally less ambitious than the CPTPP\u2019s, and the deal is also much harder to negotiate. Nonetheless, I hope the participants can take the final step to complete the RCEP by this year, or if not, as soon as the domestic politics of the key players allow.Of course, regional cooperation goes beyond trade. In Southeast Asia, ASEAN has provided 10 very different countries an effective platform for dialogue and cooperation. ASEAN has deepened ties and kept the peace amongst its members. It has become an effective regional partner of other countries, and enabled its members to project a stronger external presence as a group.ASEAN works on the basis of consensus. It makes more progress in some areas than others, because ASEAN members are not immune to the strategic forces that pull us in different directions. This is the hard reality of cooperation in a region exposed to multiple external influences. Despite its limitations, ASEAN has contributed much to the well-being of its members and the security of the region, and ASEAN\u2019s partners recognise the value of ASEAN Centrality.Amid the geopolitical shifts, new concepts and platforms for regional cooperation have emerged, notably China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Singapore supports the BRI. We see it as a constructive mechanism for China to be positively engaged with the region and beyond. That is why we are active participants. For example, we work with the World Bank to promote financial and infrastructure connectivity, and we provide supporting professional and legal services to BRI countries. We are also partnering China to develop the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor, which connects Western China to Southeast Asia under the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Connectivity Initiative (CCI-ILSTC).Of course the substance of the BRI, and the way in which the BRI is implemented, are important. The specific projects must be economically sound and commercially viable, and must bring long term benefits to its partners. This has not always been the case; some BRI projects have run into significant problems. Overall, the BRI must be open and inclusive, and must not turn the region into a closed bloc centred on a single major economy. As Asian countries deepen their links with China, they also need to grow their ties with the US, Europe, Japan and others. In other words, the BRI should help China to integrate with the world. The end result should be to strengthen globalisation, and not to divide the world into rival spheres of influence.I believe China appreciates this. At the recent Belt and Road Forum in Beijing, Chinese leaders stated clearly that the BRI would be \u201copen, green and clean\u201d. China\u2019s Finance Minister set out debt sustainability requirements for Belt and Road projects, which the IMF has welcomed. In the nature of such reassurances, the test will be how these statements of intent are implemented in practice, but these are steps in the right direction.Meanwhile, other initiatives have been proposed for regional cooperation. For example, several countries have proposed various concepts of \u201cIndo-Pacific cooperation\u201d. These ideas are less fully elaborated or implemented than the BRI, but Singapore\u2019s attitude towards them is consistent. We support regional cooperation initiatives which are open and inclusive platforms for countries to cooperate constructively, and deepen regional integration. These initiatives should strengthen existing cooperation arrangements centred on ASEAN. They should not undermine them, create rival blocs, deepen fault lines or force countries to take sides. They should help bring countries together, rather than split them apart.ConclusionUS-China relations will define the tenor of international relations for years to come. It is natural that the two powers will vie for power and influence, but competition should not inevitably lead to conflict. We hope the US and China find a constructive way forward, competing certainly, but at the same time cooperating on major issues of mutual interest.Some people argue that compromise is not possible or perhaps even desirable, because the US and China hold such different values. Indeed, one US official recently defined the clash with China as \u201ca fight with a really different civilisation and a different ideology\u201d. Others observe that the US is a young country that wants everyone to be like them, while China is an old country that believes no one else can be like them.To expect every country to adopt the same cultural values and political system is neither reasonable nor realistic. In fact, humankind\u2019s diversity is its strength. There is much we can learn from one another, from the differences in our values, perspectives, systems, and policies. The story of humankind\u2019s progress has been one of exchange of ideas, and continuous learning and adaptation.Henry Kissinger said last year that \u201cwe are in a very, very grave period for the world\u201d. No one can predict which way events will develop. At different times in the last two centuries, Southeast Asia has seen rivalry between great powers. It has experienced destruction and suffering from war and occupation. It has been divided into opposing camps. It has seen how isolation from the world economy led to stagnation and sometimes conflict. At other times, it has benefited from international cooperation that created an open, stable environment where countries could prosper in peace.On a long view, we cannot rule out any of these eventualities. But in our own generation, we must work together to maximise the chances that countries will have the wisdom and courage to make the right choices, opt for openness and integration, peace and cooperation, and so preserve and expand the progress which we have made together.Thank you very much."},

A commentary\n    AdvertisementConsider trade. In 2018, the US had a US$419 billion merchandise trade deficit with China, fully 48 per cent of the massive overall trade gap of US$879 billion.This is the lightening rod in the debate, the culprit behind what US President Donald Trump calls the \u201ccarnage\u201d of job losses and wage pressures.But what Trump \u2013 and most other US politicians \u2013 won\u2019t admit is that the US ran trade deficits with 102 countries in 2018. This reflects a profound shortfall of domestic saving, owing in large part to the reckless budget deficits approved by none other than Congress and the president.READ:\u00a0Huawei still the standard bearer for 5G, a commentaryNor is there any recognition of supply-chain distortions \u2013 arising from inputs made in other countries but assembled and shipped from China \u2013 that are estimated to overstate the US-China trade imbalance by as much as 35 to 40 per cent.Never mind basic macroeconomics and new efficiencies from global production platforms that benefit US consumers. Apparently, it is much easier to vilify China as the major obstacle to making America great again.SO MUCH FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFTNext, consider intellectual property theft. It is now accepted \u201ctruth\u201d that China is stealing hundreds of billions of dollars of US intellectual property each year, driving a stake into the heart of America\u2019s innovative prowess.According to the accepted source of this claim, the so-called IP Commission, in 2017 IP theft cost the US economy between US$225 and US$600 billion.Leaving aside the ridiculously broad range of such an estimate, the figures rest on flimsy evidence derived from dubious \u201cproxy modeling\u201d that attempts to value stolen trade secrets via nefarious activities such as narcotics trafficking, corruption, occupational fraud, and illicit financial flows.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA US factory. (File photo: AFP/Robyn Beck)\n                            \n\n                    \n                The Chinese piece of this alleged theft comes from US Customs and Border Patrol data, which reported US$1.35 billion in seizures of total counterfeit and pirated goods back in 2015.Equally dubious models extrapolate this tiny sum into an aggregate guesstimate for the US and impute 87 per cent of the total to China (52 per cent to the mainland and 35 per cent to Hong Kong).WHAT FORCED TECH TRANSFER?Then there is the red herring emphasised in the Section 301 report published by the US Trade Representative (USTR) in March 2018, which provides the foundational justification for tariffs levied on China: Forced technology transfer between US companies and their Chinese joint venture (JV) partners.The key word is \u201cforced,\u201d which implies that innocent US companies that enter willingly into contractual agreements with Chinese counterparts are coerced into surrendering their proprietary technologies in order to do business in the country.To be sure, JVs obviously entail a sharing of people, business strategies, operating platforms, and product designs.But the charge is coercion, which is inseparable from the presumption that sophisticated US multinationals are dumb enough to turn over core proprietary technologies to their Chinese partners.READ:\u00a0Why China is making a strong push for financial literacy in schools, a commentaryThis is another shocking example of soft evidence for a hard allegation. Incredibly, the USTR actually admits in the Section 301 report (on page 19) that there is no hard evidence to confirm these \u201cimplicit practices.\u201dLike the IP Commission, the USTR relies instead on proxy surveys from trade organisations like the US-China Business Council, whose respondents complain of some discomfort with China\u2019s treatment of their technology.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nMidea's US$5 billion acquisition of industrial robotics firm Kuka sparked fears in Berlin that valuable knowhow and technology was being transferred to China.

In February, Trump issued an executive order announcing the establishment of an AI Initiative, complete with a framework to develop an AI action plan within 120 days.China is hardly alone in elevating innovation to a national policy priority.WHAT CURRENCY MANIPULATION?Finally, there is the time-worn issue of Chinese currency manipulation \u2013 the fear that China will deliberately depress the renminbi to gain unfair competitive advantage.Yet its broad trade-weighted currency has risen over 50 per cennt in real terms since late 2004. And China\u2019s once-outsized current-account surplus has all but vanished.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nDubbing himself 'Tariff Man,' Trump said he would not hesitate to make China 'pay for the privilege' of selling in the United States.

This only compounds the false narrative.All in all, Washington has been loose with facts, analysis, and conclusions, and the American public has been far too gullible in its acceptance of this false narrative.READ:\u00a0China a country with great strengths, but also important weaknesses, a commentaryThe point is not to deny China\u2019s role in promoting economic tensions with the US, but to stress the need for objectivity and honesty in assigning blame \u2013 especially with so much at stake in the current conflict.Sadly, fixating on scapegoats is apparently much easier than taking a long, hard look in the mirror.Stephen S Roach, a faculty member at Yale University and former Chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, is the author of Unbalanced: The Codependency of America and China."},

Its economy remains the most innovative and powerful, and its military capabilities far exceed anyone else's.\u201dMr Lee acknowledged that while China might be abreast or even ahead\u00a0of the US in some fields, it would be \u201cmany years\u201d before China could equal the US.\u201cAnd contrary to what some people in China think, the US is not a declining power, nor is it withdrawing from the world,\u201d he added.\u201cIn fact, the US has made clear its intention to compete robustly, though in a different mode than before.\u201dMr Lee concluded that there was \u201cno strategic inevitability\u201d about a US-China face-off. \u201cBut at the same time, if such a face-off does happen, it will be nothing like the Cold War.\u201dEven if things fall short of an outright conflict, Mr Lee said a prolonged period of tension and uncertainty would be \u201cextremely damaging\u201d.\u201cMany serious international problems like the Korean situation, nuclear non-proliferation, and climate change cannot be tackled without the full participation of the US and China, together with other countries,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIn economic terms the loss will be not just a percentage point or two of world GDP, but the huge benefits of globalised markets and production chains, and the sharing of knowledge and breakthroughs that enable all countries to progress faster together.\u201dTherefore, Mr Lee stressed that the \u201cutmost\u201d must be done to avoid going down the path of conflict, and causing enmity on both sides that would last for generations.\u201cOf course, it is the duty of security and defence establishments to think the unthinkable, and plan for worst case scenarios,\u201d he stated.\u201cBut it is the responsibility of political leaders to find solutions to head off these extreme outcomes.\u201dCHANGING US-CHINA RELATIONSMoving forward, Mr Lee said how the US and China work out their tensions and frictions would define the international environment for decades to come.\u201cThe US-China bilateral relationship is the most important in the world today,\u201d he said, noting that their relationship has \u201caltered significantly\u201d.For instance, since China started opening up 40 years ago, its GDP per capita has grown by more than 25 times in real terms, making it the second largest economy in the world.The world has also benefited from China\u2019s development and success, Mr Lee said.\u201cChina has become a massive production and manufacturing base, lowering costs for the world\u2019s producers, first for labour-intensive goods, and now increasingly for high-tech\u00a0and technology-intensive production,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is also a huge market, importing everything from commodities and electronic components to aircraft and fine wines.\u201cOn the consumer side, billions of people worldwide buy all manner of products, from Barbie dolls and basketballs to drones and mobile phones, made in China, though often incorporating foreign components and technology.\u201dREAD:\u00a0In full: PM Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s speech at the 2019 Shangri-La DialogueUPHOLDING INTERNATIONAL TRADEAt the same time, Mr Lee said China\u2019s growth has shifted and continues to shift the strategic balance and economic centre of gravity of the world.\u201cChina has to recognise that it is in a totally new situation created by its own success,\u201d he said, pointing out that it could no longer expect to be treated the same way as in the past when it was much smaller and weaker.\u201cChina may still be decades away from becoming a fully developed advanced country, but it cannot wait decades before taking on larger responsibilities.\u201dAnd having gained much from the international system, Mr Lee said China now has a \u201csubstantial stake\u201d in upholding the system and making it work for the global community.\u201cChinese leaders have spoken up strongly in support of globalisation and a rules-based international order,\u201d he added.\u201cChina must now convince other countries through its actions that it does not take a transactional and mercantilist approach, but rather an enlightened and inclusive view of its long-term interests.\u201dFor example, Mr Lee pointed out that China has almost tripled its share of merchandise trade since joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001.\u201cThis is why the trade arrangements and concessions that China negotiated when it joined the WTO are no longer politically wearable for other countries,\u201d he said.Mr Lee added that it was in China\u2019s interest to prevent the international trade framework from breaking down, and to implement \u201ctimely changes\u201d that bring \u201cgreater reciprocity and parity\u201d with its trading partners.WIELDING RESTRAINT IN MARITIME ASPIRATIONSSimilarly in the area of security, Mr Lee highlighted that China\u2019s words and actions were seen differently, now that it was a major power with the second largest defence budget in the world.\u201cTo protect its territories and trade routes, it is natural that China would want to develop modern and capable armed forces, and aspire to become not just a continental power, but also a maritime power,\u201d he said.\u201cAt the same time, to grow its international influence beyond hard power - military strength - China needs to wield this strength with restraint and legitimacy.\u201dNevertheless, Mr Lee said friction\u00a0will arise between China and other countries from time to time, pointing to the overlapping maritime claims in the South China Sea as an example.\u201cChina should resolve these disputes peacefully, in accordance with international law, including UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea),\u201d he said.\u201cIt should do so through diplomacy and compromise rather than force or the threat of force, while giving weight to the core interests and rights of other countries.\u201cThen over time it will build its reputation as a responsible and benevolent power that need not be feared.

This is estimated to cost American businesses hundreds of billions of dollars a year.But China is unlikely to end industrial subsidies or increase enforcement of intellectual property laws in any meaningful way in the short run. In part this is because the Chinese economy is growing more slowly than at any other time in the last two decades, and any significant change in policy would be risky.READ: Trump's tariff tussle and the damage to Pax Americana, a commentaryChina might be persuaded to transition away from this economic model in the long run if the proper incentives are put in place.\u00a0But it remains to be seen whether the Trump administration has the patience to compromise on its short-run objectives in order to create a long-run path toward a more level playing field.TOO MANY STICKS AND NOT ENOUGH CARROTSThe US negotiating position has been heavy on \u201csticks\u201d and light on \u201ccarrots\u201d.Even before the trade war, Chinese companies faced significant tariffs when exporting to the US \u2013 some dating back to before China joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001.

Overall, these tariffs are nearly twice as high as the tariffs that the Trump administration has so far imposed during the current trade war.Ultimately, China does not want to appear to be folding to US pressure when it already faces significant, and likely non-negotiable, tariffs.So unless the US decides to offer China some kind of carrot, such as reducing these underlying duties, trade talks will undoubtedly continue to stall \u2013 or will achieve little.READ:\u00a0US-China relations have entered a new and more fractious phase, a commentaryMORE PAIN MEANS FEWER GAINSThe costs of the trade war up to now have been high, but could get much worse. And that could lower the odds of ending it.So far consumers may not have noticed the tariffs since they are spread across thousands of products and, in some cases, have been absorbed by US companies for competitive reasons.Nevertheless they have cost each American around US$11 per month, according to a recent study by economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Columbia University and Princeton University \u2013 which is not insignificant.In fact, the Trump administration inadvertently provided an ideal test case for the calculation of these costs when it imposed a tariff on imported washing machines in January. As it turns out, approximately 1,800 jobs were created in the US as a result of this policy, which was exactly its intended effect.However, the rise in the price of washing machines and, incidentally, dryers, cost consumers over US$1.5 billion. This means each job cost US$815,000, which is an expensive and inefficient way to boost US employment.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nU.S. President Donald signed\u00a0directives to impose tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels at the White House in Washington, US on\u00a0Jan\u00a023, 2018.

Trump has also said he plans to slap a tariff on every other Chinese export in the coming months if a deal isn\u2019t reached.This would likely curb US economic growth by half a percentage point in 2020 and cost 300,000 jobs, according to Oxford Economics.With the accumulation of tariffs, and the passing of time, the need for greater concessions from China to justify these costs becomes more pressing \u2013 and becomes less likely to be met. This is a key reason that economists nearly unanimously agree that trade wars are not \"easy to win\",\u00a0as Trump claims.More often than not everyone loses.Greg Wright is Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of California, Merced.

This week's outburst was likely little more than the isolated state's way of reminding South Korea and the US\u00a0that, though poor, North Korea won't be pressured into doing something that isn't in their interest, and that they still ultimately hold the key to the summit.While some progress has been made, the question of how to convince North Korea to move out of nuclear isolation and into the international community is still daunting.The goal of the meeting is North Korea's denuclearisation, and that can only happen if the North wants it to. By thumbing its nose at South Korea and alluding to the possibility of bailing on the US,\u00a0the North has sent the message the regime is still a tough customer and, in light of recent actions, is still angling to come out on top.Steven Borowiec is the politics editor of Korea Expose."},

Antitrust law \u2014called competition law in many jurisdictions, including Singapore \u2014 has potential answers. This is the type of law that the Singapore authorities used in 2018 to fine Grab and Uber for their merger.The most drastic solution? Antitrust regulators could force Facebook to sell Instagram, and maybe WhatsApp too. It\u2019s worth considering.\u00a0Under United States law, the Clayton Act of 1914 enables the government to prohibit or undo mergers and acquisitions of competing firms. \u00a0If Facebook and a completely independent Instagram were competing for our attention, the theory is that they would innovate faster to avoid losing users.\u00a0Networks might roll out more features. Users of the Chinese social media giants rave about features, including the integration of e-commerce and digital payments, that Facebook\u2019s networks lack.\u00a0Maybe Facebook and Instagram would even compete on dimensions like how much they protect our privacy.Antitrust experts are increasingly advocating a Facebook breakup. Notable is Professor Tim Wu of Columbia Law School, who in 2018 published the book\u00a0The Curse of Bigness. The Freedom from Facebook campaign also urges antitrust action.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nPeople stand in front of a logo at Facebook's headquarters in London, Britain.

China, a commentaryOver a century ago, America lawmakers passed antitrust laws to thwart monopolies that reduced consumers\u2019 choices. Standard Oil controlled 90 per cent of the oil business, and slashed prices to put competitors out of business. Regulators broke it into dozens of independent, competing companies.In November, President Trump said his administration is looking into antitrust action against Facebook and other tech giants.\u00a0Facebook will be well armed for the battle. In November, it hired away a senior US Justice Department antitrust lawyer for its own legal department.\u00a0Just days ago, the New York Times reported Facebook\u2019s plans to integrate its messenger platforms \u2014 WhatsApp, Instagram\u2019s messaging, and Facebook Messenger \u2014 by integrating their infrastructure. The move would further reduce distinct options for consumers, and make splitting up the company more difficult, but not impossible.Regulators from the United Kingdom and the European Union are also exploring options. In December, the UK Parliament released emails of Facebook executives, obtained for its investigations, that show possibly anticompetitive conduct.\u00a0In a 2013 email, Mark Zuckerberg personally decided not to enable users of Twitter\u2019s video-sharing app, Vine, to find their Facebook friends on Vine.\u00a0Many nations have law regulating competition in their jurisdictions, though things get complicated when global social networks are involved.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nThe WhatsApp app logo is seen on a smartphone in this picture illustration,\u00a0Sep\u00a015, 2017. (Photo: Reuters/Dado Ruvic)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Individual nations may be able to take action against Facebook. But if the goal is a global split of Facebook and Instagram into competing firms, it would probably take the American authorities to force a sale of Instagram.HOW WE GOT HERE, AND HOW TO DIG OUTThere\u2019s a simpler alternative to breaking up a corporation: Not letting it acquire its competitors in the first place.\u00a0United States and European antitrust regulators didn\u2019t flinch when Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.\u00a0In 2012, UK regulators didn\u2019t see Instagram, a camera app, as a direct competitor to Facebook. They said, \u201cConsumers take and upload photos, but do not spend a significant amount of time\u201d in Instagram\u2019s app, so it presents few opportunities for marketing.\u00a0American antitrust regulators may have reached similar conclusions, but they don\u2019t publish their reasoning for letting the acquisition\u00a0proceed. \u00a0Facebook no doubt recognised Instagram as a potential competitor, but the regulators lacked foresight. Though Instagram focuses on photos, it is, after all, a social network where many users now spend more time than on Facebook. Advertising is now fully integrated.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n(Photo: Unsplash/Katka Pavlickova)\n                            \n\n                    \n                How the American authorities have enforced antitrust law in the last half century presents obstacles to taking aggressive action against social networks.\u00a0In recent decades, American regulators and courts have focused antitrust analysis narrowly on whether consumers pay more because of a monopoly, rather than broader questions about consumers\u2019 choices. As a result, antitrust enforcement has waned.Regulators haven\u2019t broken up a firm since 1982, when they split the AT&T telephone company into regional telephone companies. Twenty years ago, antitrust regulators sought to break up Microsoft, which was bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its operating system, but the case was settled with conditions short of a breakup.\u00a0If the question the authorities ask is whether social network users pay more because of Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram, the answer is no, because social networks don\u2019t require users to pay in dollars. We \u201cpay\u201d with the data we disclose, which the networks use to sell advertising targeted to us.\u00a0If the question the authorities ask is whether the acquisition has undercut competition \u2014 consumer options \u2014 the answer is surely yes.\u00a0That\u2019s the question regulators should ask. American authorities should revive interpretations of anti-trust law that focus broadly on whether competition is suffering. \u00a0A breakup of Facebook is worth considering. It\u2019s too early in the history of social media for winners and losers to have been decided, and for the winners to have the same owner and little incentive to innovate. \u00a0Less drastic measures, like fines for reducing competition in a country\u2014such as the fines that Singapore, then the Philippines, imposed for the Grab-Uber merger \u2014 help increase the pressure to preserve competition.\u00a0READ:\u00a0Grab, the new ruler in town, and the paradox of scaling a business, a commentary\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA probe found the merger between Uber and Grab had substantially reduced 'competition in the ride-hailing platform market in Singapore' (Photo: AFP/ROSLAN RAHMAN)\n                            \n\n                    \n                We can also learn from the past. If Facebook attempts to buy another social network \u2014 like Snapchat, which it attempted to acquire in 2013\u2014 consumers around the world should howl their disapproval. Regulators should prevent it.\u00a0THE CASE FOR MULTIPLE NETWORKSI don\u2019t believe that deleting one\u2019s Facebook account is the answer for individual users who are dissatisfied with it. What we\u2019ve all built \u2014 a network that connects so many of us globally \u2014 has value.\u00a0Facebook has allowed me to stay in touch with alumni of the school where I teach. It\u2019s good for preserving these low-maintenance relationships with people from different eras of our lives. It was better while everyone was still building their networks and posting regularly.\u00a0If large numbers of users quit or go dormant on Facebook \u2014 and maybe on Instagram too \u2014 and competitors were to proliferate, what would the downside be?\u00a0The textbook answer is that a network gains value, to its users, when more people join. It loses value as people leave or become less active.\u00a0Bigger is better.\u00a0A social network impresses us when we meet people from across the street, and across the planet, and can stay in touch with all on the same network.\u00a0If users of the big social networks \u2014 Facebook\u2019s 2 billion users, and Instagram\u2019s 1 billion \u2014 disperse into smaller, disparate networks, Facebook would no longer be fulfilling its stated mission of \u201cconnecting the world\u201d. We\u2019d lose something if no big global network took its place.\u00a0Even though the textbooks tell us a network\u2019s value increases with more users, my students remind me of another perspective.\u00a0There\u2019s value in not spending time on the same network as everyone you know.\u00a0We can learn from young people who are happy to maintain accounts on multiple networks. They post occasionally to Facebook and regularly to Instagram. For chat, they occasionally use Facebook\u2019s apps \u2014 message services of Facebook and Instagram, and WhatsApp \u2014 but chat most with peers on Telegram.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nWhatsApp and Facebook messenger icons are seen on an iPhone in Manchester, Britain March 27, 2017.

It would be a hassle to send out friend invitations again. The law also has a possible antidote. Platforms could be required to let us download our connections and transfer them to other platforms, if our connections consent.\u00a0Maybe the rise of a new social network is not such a remote possibility, especially if the network offers innovative features. Many of us might enjoy exploring new social networks, just as we travel in different social circles offline. \u00a0To restore competition, I\u2019ll be rooting for the regulators to break up Facebook and Instagram. Meanwhile, if another network starts to gain momentum, sign me up.\u00a0And this time, I may even pay attention to the privacy policy.\u00a0Mark Cenite teaches media law and is Associate Chair (Academic) at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication & Information at Nanyang Technological University.\u00a0"},

Low labour productivity, an inadequate education system, an inefficient judiciary, corruption and organised crime are problems with a long history.READ:\u00a0Commentary: COVID-19 and Africa: \u2018The dog that hasn\u2019t barked\u2019READ: Commentary: The perfect storm for a COVID-19 outbreak lies in North KoreaSince the late-20th century Italy\u2019s public debt has been worryingly high. But whereas before the 2010 crisis it amounted to a little over 100 per cent of gross domestic product, now it is approaching 135 per cent of GDP.From a public health point of view, Italy\u2019s emergency measures are essential. But they carry risks for the multitude of small, family-run businesses that depend on daily contact with customers and cash transactions that are drying up.RESCUE PACKAGE NOT ENOUGHGiuseppe Conte, Italy\u2019s prime minister, said on Wednesday that the government was setting aside \u20ac25 billion (US$28 billion), or about 1.4 per cent of GDP, to protect the economy against these threats.However, prominent economists such as Lorenzo Codogno, a former director-general of Italy\u2019s Treasury, and Ashoka Mody, a Princeton University professor, doubt that this will be enough. They think the risks from the pandemic are so high that Italy, the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy, should request immediate financial assistance from the eurozone bailout fund and maybe the IMF.Uppermost in everyone\u2019s mind is the thought that, if Italy were to need help, the cost might run to hundreds of billions of euros.Almost certainly it would be no straightforward matter to win the approval of other European governments, divided as they are over eurozone reform, refugee policies and other issues touching on national sovereignty.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nPeople applaud Italian\u2019s doctors, during a flash mob to raise morale, as the Italian government continues restrictive movement measures to combat the coronavirus outbreak, in Rome, Italy March 14, 2020.

Rescue measures agreed during the sovereign debt crisis stirred much resentment in debtor countries, where politicians and voters complained about what they saw as the intrusive, humiliating supervision of foreigners.But these measures also stirred up anger in creditor countries such as Germany, Finland and the Netherlands, indignant at forking out billions for supposedly feckless neighbours.All in all, the bailouts left a legacy of rightwing nationalism, anti-establishment populism and an unwillingness to go the extra mile for the EU that could make large-scale financial assistance for Italy a politically explosive proposition.The recent failure of governments to agree on the EU\u2019s 2021 to 2027 budget illustrates the point. The sums of money in dispute were mere fractions of each government\u2019s national budget, but no leader felt able to risk the wrath of voters at home by making concessions.READ: Commentary: Think flying is dead?

WAS THIS ATTACK INEVITABLE AND WHO IS TO BLAME?Responsibility must first be with the alleged terrorist himself, of course. But before we accept the argument that there is a direct causal link between the attack and the political rhetoric of people like Senator Fraser Anning and One Nation, shock jocks and conservative media, let\u2019s wait for a more thorough analysis of Tarrant\u2019s online activities and any meetings he had or contacts he made during his travels.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nBrenton Tarrant, charged for murder in relation to the mosque attacks, is lead into the dock for his appearance in the Christchurch District Court, New Zealand, Mar\u00a016, 2019.

If any of those mentioned above are proven to have influenced his thinking, then they must be held to account. But if not, then the claim of a direct causal link is much less persuasive.2. SHOULD THIS PORTEND A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN THREAT PERCEPTIONS?\n    AdvertisementIt is too early to tell. Naturally, when 50 people peacefully observing their religious practices are killed, some things must change.\u00a0Government has a fundamental obligation to protect the community, and if white supremacists as a group are considered a threat after a thorough assessment of the circumstances surrounding this attack has been conducted, then there will be a sharper focus on such groups.\u00a0What is certain is that such an assessment will take into account the events in Christchurch and will be informed by data gleaned from the investigation into Tarrant\u2019s contacts.3. WAS THIS AN INTELLIGENCE FAILURE?New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said:\u00a0\u201cThis individual should have been someone that the authorities were aware of and were proactively already focused on\u201d\u00a0But it is way too early to decide whether this is a fair criticism.\u00a0It is easy to label any successful terrorist attack as an intelligence failure, but it isn\u2019t realistic to expect perfect intelligence in an imperfect world, even less so in a liberal democracy where individual rights correctly limit the scope of law enforcement and security agencies\u2019 activities. If an individual is acting alone, the challenges are even greater.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern speaks to representatives of the Muslim community at Canterbury refugee centre in Christchurch, New Zealand March 16, 2019.

WAS HE MISSED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WAS A WHITE MALE FROM GRAFTON?Likely not. Resources are finite, and threats need to be prioritised.For example, the Khayat brothers, who will go on trial soon in Australia for an alleged attempt to bomb an aircraft on behalf of Islamic State, an attack which would have killed hundreds of people, had a brother who was fighting with Islamic State in Syria and two nephews who had been killed fighting for Islamic State.\u00a0Yet there was nothing in their activities nor history in Australia that placed them on a watch list here.READ:\u00a0Islamic State brides and the meaning of citizenship, a commentarySo it should come as no surprise that someone with objectionable views but without any criminal record or, as far as we know, history of violence or threats wasn\u2019t on the radar. Warrants and the like have to be based on demonstrable evidence, not gut feel, or dislike of an individual\u2019s views.5. WHY DID HE UNDERTAKE THE ATTACK IN NEW ZEALAND?This will be a key line of inquiry. Are there trans-Tasman far-right/white supremacist links we\u2019re unaware of? White supremacists tend to attack locally, which makes this one somewhat unusual.\u00a0He was obviously out to kill as many Muslims as possible and said he had been planning the attack for two years. Perhaps Australia\u2019s strict gun laws (which have frustrated planning by Islamist terrorists in this country) meant he looked for a more permissive environment, and New Zealand\u2019s relatively looser gun laws offered an opportunity.\u00a0Dr Rodger Shanahan is a Research Fellow at the Lowy Institute.

I think he is absolutely very serious.\"He suggested that Kim's apparent about-face may have been at the behest of Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\"There was a difference when Kim Jong Un left China the second time,\" Trump said. \"There was a different attitude after that meeting and I was a little surprised.\"And I think things changed after that meeting so I can't say that I am happy about it.\"And Trump again raised the prospect of a windfall for Kim if he mothballs weapons programmes. \"He will be extremely happy\" if the deal works out, Trump said. \"He will be very happy.\"RESCUE MISSIONMoon's trip to the White House represented an effort to salvage the rare diplomatic opening.The dovish South Korean leader deployed a tactic frequently used by foreign leaders who meet this most mercurial of presidents: flattery.\"Thanks to your vision of achieving peace through strength as well as your strong leadership,\" Moon said in the Oval office, \"we find ourselves standing one step closer to the dream of achieving denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula.\"\"All this was possible because of you, Mr\u00a0President,\" Moon added, taking pains to stress the concrete results of diplomacy so far - most notably the release of three US prisoners from North Korean jail.Trump praised his guest, but also indicated that a separate, second round of high-level talks between Moon and Kim may also be on ice. \"Right now, he doesn't know whether or not he has a meeting,\" Trump said of Moon.South Korea -\u00a0deeply worried about Kim's bellicose weapons testing and Trump's similarly bellicose warnings about \"fire and fury\" - was instrumental in convincing the two Cold War foes to sit down and talk.Moon sent his own national security advisor to the White House in March, carrying an offer of talks and word that North Korea may be willing to abandon nuclear weapons, an enticing prospect.Trump surprised his guests, his own aides and the world by summarily accepting the meeting, seeing an opportunity to \"do a deal\" and avoid military confrontation.Analysts saw North Korea's perceived slow peddling as evidence of what they feared all along, that Pyongyang may have been playing for time - hoping to ease sanctions and \"maximum pressure,\" or of South Korea over torquing the prospects of a deal.\"The current episode of tension reflects a wide and dangerous expectation gap between the United States and North Korea,\" said Eric Gomez of the CATO Institute.\"Denuclearisation is not off the table for the North, but it expects the United States to end the so-called 'hostile policy' as a precondition for denuclearisation.\"It is far from clear what that means concretely, but it could include the withdrawal of 30,000 US troops from the Korean peninsula.Trump has been similarly unclear about his own policy.He indicated the United States may not demand North Korea give up its nuclear programme before getting sanctions relief -\u00a0a sequencing he said was a fatal flaw of the Iran nuclear deal he scrapped.\"It would certainly be better if it were all in one. Does it have to be? I don't think I'm going to totally commit myself,\" Trump\u00a0said.Pyongyang is on the verge of marrying nuclear and missile technology allowing it to hit the continental United States with a nuke, a capability Washington has said is wholly unacceptable.Administration officials refused to speculate on when Trump would make a decision on the summit.\"We are prepared,\" said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, saying Trump had asked them to follow through with preparations.\"I'm not a betting man.

last year it sent three of its aircraft carriers to the waters off the peninsula simultaneously.But on Tuesday, the Pentagon called the drills \"defensive\" in nature.The North has consistently condemned military drills as preparations for invasion, and in the past has often responded with actions and provocations of its own in a cycle of events.The major Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises, usually around March, have often sent tensions on the peninsula soaring.But this year, the allies delayed those drills until after the Olympics and Paralympics in Pyeongchang as Moon sought to secure the North's participation at the Games.In turn, envoys from Seoul said Kim told them he would \"understand\" if the exercises went ahead, which they did without incident.Pyongyang has dramatically toned down its condemnations of its enemies in recent months. But it has a long history of switching from aggression to engagement, or vice versa.The day after the Panmunjom summit, KCNA condemned a US exercise to train for the evacuation of its nationals from the South, calling it \"an act aimed to make war a fait accompli and incite atmosphere for it\"."},

This is the third time this year the US has conducted freedom of navigation operations next to Chinese-claimed territory.Coinciding with last week\u2019s stalled trade talks, the US also barred the large Chinese telecommunications operator, China Mobile, from operating in the US.

Maybe it's time to pay attention to China, a commentaryREAD:\u00a0Huawei may create a world split along tech lines, a commentaryA NEW AND FRACTIOUS PHASE OF RELATIONSWhile it would be premature to describe a messy pause in US-China trade negotiations as an inflexion moment in an increasingly complex relationship, it is unarguable that US-China relations have entered a new and more fractious phase.What is unclear is whether a more overtly competitive relationship is bringing closer the day when the gloves really do come off in a way that threatens global harmony.In any case, it seems clear a period of relative amity, during which the US and China sought to achieve a reasonable balance between an old and a new global order, is over.Benn Steil, director of the international economics programme at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Bloomberg that rivalry between the US and China for control of everything from global trade routes to cyberspace will drive the relationship for years to come. He said:The heady era of global integration is gone.This view may prove alarmist, but, on latest indications, overcoming trade and other differences between Washington and Beijing will be easier said than done.Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House, with a team of trade advisers who have made careers railing against China\u2019s uncompetitive trade practices, has brought trading differences more sharply into focus.Disputes over intellectual property, market access, alleged currency manipulation and a host of other trade issues have been present ever since China began its inexorable rise.US politicians of left and right agitate against what\u2019s perceived to be China\u2019s mercantilist trade policies. This is blamed for American jobs draining away from the country\u2019s manufacturing heartland.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

Democratic presidential hopefuls like Bernie Sanders have accused Trump of not delivering on his promises to upend US trading relationships.TRADE FRICTIONS WORSEN IN THE YEAR OF A US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONTrump\u2019s unhelpful response to the failure in Washington to achieve a breakthrough points to an uncertain conclusion to complex negotiations that would lay the foundation for a more stable relationship.This contribution to the debate provides an indication of the extent to which US-China relations have become enmeshed in American domestic politics.Trade frictions with China risk becoming more \u2013 not less \u2013 intense as a presidential election year approaches in 2020.Presidential campaigns tend to expose sharper differences on trade as the two sides compete for votes in the American rust belt, where factory closures have killed off tens of thousands of jobs.One of Trump\u2019s boasts is that he has reversed this trend by encouraging American business to reinvest onshore and bring jobs home. But disruptions to trade have their costs.Trump\u2019s tariff war against China has hit American farmers hard as the Chinese have retaliated by seeking alternative markets for agricultural commodities such as soybeans.In other words, China is not without an ability to strike back at US attempts to strong-arm it over trade.CHINA HAS GOT TO BUY INTO A DEALIn the end, a resolution of a damaging US-China trade dispute that risks broader damage to a global trading system will require the intervention of respective leaders, Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping could meet in June 2019 on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan for trade talks,\u00a0says a top White House aide.

In Chinese culture, the issue of \u201cface\u201d is important.Xi will not want to lose \u201cface\u201d in negotiations with Trump by yielding ground unduly. As US academic Patrick Chovanec writes:If we want China to embrace structural reform that requires real commitment \u2013 it\u2019s not something we can just twist their arm to do, they have to buy into it.When you basically strong-arm them into doing something they really don\u2019t want to do, and they\u2019re convinced it\u2019s harmful to their interests, at some point they are going to cheat, push back, or scuttle it, it\u2019s just a question of when, because they haven\u2019t bought into it.US-China trade negotiations risk taking more than a few steps back.Tony Walker is Adjunct Professor at the\u00a0School of Communications, La Trobe University.

Until you reach total market dominance.LISTEN:\u00a0That awkward conversation we need to have with Facebook, an episode on The PulseSilicon Valley\u2019s doctrine of high growth has been entrenched by studies that confirm high-growth can be a multiplier. When McKinsey\u00a0analysed the life cycles of 3,000 software and Internet companies in 2014, they found that a positive feedback loop made rapid growth the key factor in financial success:First, growth yields greater returns. High-growth companies offer a return to shareholders five times greater than medium-growth companies.Second, growth predicts long-term success. \u201cSupergrowers\u201d\u2014companies whose growth was greater than 60 per cent when they reached US$100 million in revenues\u2014were eight times more likely to reach US$1 billion in revenues than those growing less than 20 per cent.But the consumer Internet is slowing to single-digit growth. Tech giants are being boxed in. Instead of blitzscaling, they are fighting for market share.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nSmall toy figures are seen in front of a\u00a0Linkedin logo in this illustration on\u00a0August 30, 2018.

For instance, in 2012, when Google bought Motorola for US$12.5 billion in an attempt to enter the hardware business, it ended up fire-selling Motorola to Lenovo at US$2.9 billion.The Nexus tablet similarly failed to take off, and Google\u2019s fiber division shuttered after failing to popularise its ultra-fast Internet service.Even the much-hyped Google Glass, which heralded the arrival of augmented reality, turned out to be a flop. Moreover, the company\u2019s early dabbling in self-driving cars resulted in Waymo, which has yet to gain commercial traction.CREATIVITY PLUMMETS IN BIG FIRMSBureaucracy and administration nearly always kill companies. Celebrated physicist, Geoffrey West, has observed that cities exhibit super-linear growth\u2014as a city gets bigger, every person there becomes more productive, but companies exhibit the exact opposite trend.Creativity and innovation plummet in a big firm because, inside a big company, \u201csomeone has got to take care of the taxes and the bills and the cleaning the floors and the maintenance of the building and all the rest of that stuff.\u201dREAD:\u00a0This low global growth is structural, not cyclical, a commentaryAll the moonshot ambition notwithstanding, Silicon Valley is now struggling to come up with a new business model.

Its arrest of Ren's daughter, Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, in December on a US extradition bid linked to Iran sanctions violations was followed by the arrest in China of two Canadians, including a former diplomat.The battle over Huawei has added to tensions in a trade war that has escalated between the world's top two economies, with both sides exchanging steep increases in tariffs as negotiations have faltered.China's envoy to the European Union, Zhang Ming, called the move against Huawei \"wrong behaviour\", adding \"there will be a necessary response\".Asked how long Huawei may face difficult times, Ren said: \"You may need to ask Trump about this question, not me.\""},

The novel coronavirus outbreak is just the latest example.These misleading articles have spread quickly, and are likely to be behind the shortage of vitamin C in Asia and a five-fold spike in demand for vitamin C and multivitamins in Singapore.VITAMIN C CAN PROMOTE A GOOD IMMUNE SYSTEMVitamin C is important to maintain \u201credox\u201d balance in the body\u2019s tissues \u2013 these are types of reactions in cells that add or remove oxygen, and are essential for many processes such as generating energy in cells.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nShoppers browse for health products in an aisle stocked with vitamin supplements at a\u00a0store in Sydney, Australia on\u00a0Mar\u00a09, 2017. (Photo: Reuters/Jason Reed)\n                            \n\n                    \n                These same reactions, though, can create products harmful to human cells \u2013 such as reactive oxygen species, which react with lipids (fat), proteins and nucleic acids. Vitamin C can lessen these harmful reactions. It also help enzymes build collagen, which is necessary for supporting our body\u2019s tissues.Although vitamin C doesn\u2019t have miraculous disease-curing properties, some research has also shown it can help the immune system fight off bacteria and viruses.Its role in protecting against viral infections was shown in a recent review which found that immune cells need vitamin C to produce proteins that activate the immune system throughout the body against virus attacks.Having said that, we can easily obtain sufficient levels of vitamin C in our diet that will keep our immune system fully functional. Vitamin C is plentiful in many fruits and vegetables, including oranges, broccoli and potatoes.And while it is relatively non-toxic, since its high water solubility makes it easy to excrete from the body, excessive doses can result in unpleasant symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea and cramps.BUT IT IS UNLIKELY TO BE A DRAMATIC CUREThough I have said vitamin C is unlikely to be a dramatic cure for COVID-19, the fact that it can promote good immune function means it would be going too far to say there will be no effect.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Hot and humid weather may end the novel coronavirus \u2013 as well as the development of a vaccineREAD:\u00a0Commentary: Explosion in COVID-19 cases - was South Korea just unlucky?And although a review found that vitamin C has no effect on reducing the frequency of colds, it did find that for the average person, there was a small decrease in the duration of common cold symptoms.But for people that participate in brief periods of severe physical exercise (such as marathon runners and skiers), vitamin C halved the duration and severity of their common cold risk.These slight effects of vitamin C on the coronavirus that causes the common cold have spurred a new clinical trial looking to cure COVID-19 infections using very high intravenous doses of vitamin C. These trials have just started and no results are yet posted.Intravenous application of vitamin C will result in much higher and faster levels of the vitamin in the blood than any amount found in vitamin C supplements taken orally.Though this approach could increase vitamin C\u2019s mild protective effect, this is yet hypothetical and intravenous injection comes with its own risks, such as infection, blood vessel damage, air embolism or blood clots.WHAT TO DO INSTEAD OF TAKING VITAMIN CSo although vitamin C does have some small effect on the common cold, it\u2019s unlikely that taking large amounts of vitamin C supplements will cure a COVID-19 infection \u2013 or have a large effect at all.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n(Photo: Unsplash/Kelly Sikkema)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Even if intravenous vitamin C works to shorten or cure COVID-19, it will likely only be a stop-gap before therapies directed at the virus, such as vaccinations, take over.The most effective way to avoid the virus still remains washing hands, not touching the eyes, nose or mouth, and keeping your distance from anyone exhibiting symptoms.BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the novel coronavirus and its developmentsDownload\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegram\u00a0Peter McCaffery is Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Aberdeen.

There have been relatively few reported cases.Egypt, where dozens of Nile cruise passengers are in quarantine, is the worst affected. About 10 other countries have confirmed cases. But that only makes just over 100 cases, mostly in North Africa, in a continent of 1.2 billion people. Italy, with 60 million people, has more than 12,000 cases.If the numbers are to be believed, Africa has been remarkably lucky. So far.\u00a0There are several plausible explanations. One is that the numbers are not credible. When the outbreak began in China, there were only two labs in sub-Saharan Africa able to test for the virus.\n    AdvertisementThat situation has improved. More than 40 countries have some testing capacity.READ: Commentary: The ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic could unfold\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nPeople scrambled to buy face masks and hand sanitiser in Lagos after sub-Saharan Africa's first case of coronavirus was detected.

If the number is low, one explanation may be\u00a0that many cases have gone undetected in a population with a median age of 19.\u00a0Another is that African health systems, however under-resourced, are used to dealing with infectious diseases. When, in 2014 a Liberian man with Ebola\u00a0collapsed in the arrivals hall of Lagos airport, Nigerian authorities did a remarkable job of tracing his contacts and quarantining them, snuffing out the outbreak.Last month, when an Italian businessman became Nigeria\u2019s\u00a0first case of COVID-19, the authorities \u2013 already dealing with a far-worse Lassa fever outbreak \u2013 sprang into action. So far, the number of reported infections is just two.The third explanation is one that few scientists would dare suggest for lack of robust evidence: That the virus doesn\u2019t do well in hot weather. If that is true, there could be respite on the way in the northern hemisphere as winter turns to spring and summer.Although that would not end the epidemic, it would buy time for health systems to prepare and researchers to test a vaccine.\u00a0READ: Commentary: Hot and humid weather may end the novel coronavirus \u2013 as well as the development of a vaccineREAD: Commentary: COVID-19 crisis reveals the extraordinary promise of bioengineeringTHE ETERNAL FIGHT AGAINST INFECTIOUS DISEASESAfrica may have been spared the worst of the COVID-19 outbreak, for the time being at least.

The individual with the best medical insurance or best fitness regimen will be the healthiest.That ignores two facts. One is that the most effective health interventions, from clean water to antibiotics and vaccines, have all been collective. The second is that infectious diseases have not been defeated. They have, at best, been kept at bay.\u00a0This has implications for rich and poor regions alike. For countries such as the US or the UK, it means you ignore public health \u2013 and the health of the most vulnerable in society \u2013 at your peril.

That chamber is controlled by Republicans, who have shown little interest in removing Trump from office.House Democrats accuse Trump of abusing his power by asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, a former US\u00a0vice president and a leading Democratic contender in the 2020 election. Trump is also accused of obstructing the congressional investigation into the matter.Trump has insisted he has done nothing wrong, and on Tuesday called the process \"a total sham.\" He sent House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a lengthy letter in which he accused her of engaging in a \"perversion of justice.\"\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementThe president has denounced the probe as an \"attempted coup\" and has argued Democrats are trying to undo the results of the 2016 election that saw him defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.With Trump seeking a second term next year, impeachment has cleaved the public, with most Democratic voters supporting it and most Republicans opposed.What remains unclear is whether the months-long partisan drama will have any effect on the 2020 election beyond giving Trump reasons to boast of having beaten back Democratic efforts to remove him.Republicans contend that a \"yea\" vote on impeachment could cost some moderate House Democrats their seats in next year's congressional elections. Still, several Democrats who represent districts that backed Trump in 2016 have said in recent days they will vote to impeach him.\n    Advertisement'PRESIDENT ABUSED HIS POWER'On the eve of the vote, Pelosi sent a letter on Tuesday to all 232 Democratic members of the House, urging them to abide by the Constitution's standards.\"Very sadly, the facts have made clear that the President abused his power for his own personal, political benefit and that he obstructed Congress as he demanded that he is above accountability, above the Constitution and above the American people,\" she wrote.Fearful of the political blowback, Democrats were long resistant to an impeachment inquiry even after Special Counsel Robert Mueller outlined potential episodes of Trump obstructing justice in his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.But after a whistleblower brought to light a July phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, House Democrats moved swiftly to take testimony from current and former administration officials.Democrats accuse Trump of freezing nearly US$400 million in US\u00a0security aid to Ukraine and offering a possible White House meeting to Zelenskiy to get him to publicly announce investigations of Biden and his son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.The first article of impeachment details the Democrats' account of Trump's dealings with Ukraine. The second article accuses Trump of obstruction of Congress by directing administration officials and agencies not to comply with lawful House subpoenas for testimony and documents related to impeachment.The Senate has yet to set its procedures for a trial on the charges, which would be overseen by US\u00a0Chief Justice John Roberts.The chamber's top Republican, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has rejected Democratic proposals to call further administration officials to testify and has said there is \u201cno chance\u201d Trump will be removed from office.On Tuesday, McConnell said on the Senate floor that it would be senators' role to act as a \"judge and jury\" in the trial, but he later told reporters that he would not be \"an impartial juror.\"\"This is a political process. There is not anything judicial about it,\" he said. \"Impeachment is a political decision.\"Removing Trump from office would require a two-thirds majority of those present and voting in the 100-member chamber, meaning Democrats would have to persuade at least 20 Republicans to join with them to end Trump's presidency."},

An Australian couple were released from detention in Iran in October, following their arrest for ostensibly flying a drone without a permit.\n    Advertisement\n        \n            \n            \n                        \n\nFile photo of a remote controlled drone taking flight in an open field (Photo: Jeremy Long)\n                \n        Other tourists earned derision for scrambling to post selfies at Uluru before it was closed to climbers.Meanwhile, there is a sad story behind the newly popular Instagram destination Rainbow Mountain in the Peruvian Andes. It has reportedly only recently emerged due to climate change melting its once snowy peaks.TESTING THE EFFECTSTo understand the way social media photography impacts travelling, we undertook an exploratory study of overnight visitors at zoological accommodation in lavish surrounds.We divided 12 participants into two groups. One group was directed to abstain from posting on social media but were still able to take photos. The second group had no restrictions on sharing photos. Though the numbers were small, we gathered qualitative information about engagement and attitudes.Participants were invited to book at Jamala Wildlife Lodge in Canberra. The visit was funded by the researchers \u2013 Jamala Wildlife Lodge did not sponsor the research and the interviewees\u2019 stay at the Lodge was a standard visit.We then conducted interviews immediately after their departure from the zoo, critically exploring the full experience of their stay.The study confirmed that the desire to share travel pictures in close to real time is strongly scripted into the role of the tourist; altering the way travellers engage with sites they are visiting, but also their sense of urgency to communicate this with remote audiences.PICS OR IT DIDN\u2019T HAPPENParticipants Mandy and Amy were among those instructed to refrain from posting pictures to social media while at the zoo. They described having to refrain from social media use as a disappointment, even though it seemed to further their engagement.Interviewer: Did you look at your social media throughout your stay or did you refrain?Mandy: A bit. But even then, probably not reading it as much as I often would. I don\u2019t think I commented on anything.Amy: Even today when we put something up [after staying at the Zoo] about the things we\u2019d done today and only a few people had liked it, there was that little bit of disappointment that \"Oh more people haven\u2019t liked my post.\u201dThe desire for social media recognition resumed after leaving the zoo. For Michelle, posting after the experience presented new concerns:Interviewer: How did you feel about not being able to post?Michelle: Spanner in the works! For me personally not being able to post was a negative experience because I wanted to show people what we\u2019re doing, when we\u2019re doing it.And I also feel\u00a0like a couple of people knew we were going to the zoo\u00a0and knew that we couldn\u2019t use social media. So, when I eventually post it, they\u2019re going to say, \"She\u2019s been hanging on to those and now she\u2019s posting them and that\u2019s just a bit weird.\"\u00a0Like, to post it after the event. Everyone normally posts it in real time.Later, Michelle commented that withholding content from posting to social media also diminished a part of the experience itself:I sort of feel like if we don\u2019t share the photos it\u2019s like a tree fell down in the forest and no one heard it.\u00a0We\u2019ve had this amazing experience and if I don\u2019t share them, then no one\u2019s going to know that we had this experience.THE SELF AS CENTRE STAGE\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFILE PHOTO: A family takes a selfie photo with a mobile phone at the Beppu Bay Service Area in Beppu, Japan, October 14, 2019.

As one participant suggested:Shannon: It almost feels like it\u2019s kind of an expected behaviour when you are doing something touristy \u2026 We\u2019ve actually had tour guides before \u2026 kind of a bit disappointed if you don\u2019t take a photograph.The purpose of photography has shifted from a memory aid to a way of sharing experience in the moment. There is tension now between the need to capture tourist experiences for digital sharing and individual engagement in the tourist activity.Decrying the desire to use photography as a way of communicating experience will not constructively address this tension.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Instagram tests hiding likes but this won\u2019t bring back happinessTo ensure tourism sustainability, and engagement with their target market, tourism providers need to explore better ways to manage travellers\u2019 face-to-face and digital engagement.Digital engagement has become a defining part of travel, and organisations should be encouraged to promote online sharing of experiences \u2013 phone charging stations and photo competitions were two suggestions offered by our interviewees.In contrast, device-free days or activities could be another way to encourage face-to-face engagement and prompt tourists to be more considered with their online sharing.Michael James Walsh is an assistant professor of social science at the University of Canberra.

App developers might also be legally entitled to challenge Apple over the App Store commission, he suggested.READ:\u00a0How Apple\u2019s iPhone lost its lustre, a commentary\n    AdvertisementThat is a message that should resonate with the assembled throng at the Worldwide Developer Conference. Apple paid out US$36 billion to developers last year \u2014 implying it kept US$15 billion\u00a0or so for itself (though the 30 per cent cut is reduced for subscription services after their first year).For third-party developers, this isn\u2019t just a question of lost profits.

Apple is no longer a growth stock, a commentaryThis points to the elephant in the room at this\u00a0week\u2019s event. It takes place in the shadow of Apple\u2019s biggest-ever push into services.\u00a0Unveiled at a flashy event this spring, this involves new subscription businesses that compete directly in some of the biggest categories in the App Store, such as news, games and video.THE RETURN OF APPLE SERVICESThese subscription businesses are likely to take a back seat this\u00a0week. Instead, the conference is expected to bring updates to Apple services such as maps and messaging. These are not things that the company charges for separately, though they still compete for attention with third-party apps on the iPhone and iPad.In its defence of its App Store policies last\u00a0week, Apple listed a wide range of competing services available through its online store, from cloud storage and calendars to messaging and video chat.But as it moves closer to launching its new Arcade games service and Apple TV+ this autumn, many developers will be feeling distinctly nervous. From now on they will be competing with Apple for both attention and revenue.CONCERNS WITH APPLE'S TACTICSTwo questions loom large. The first concerns how Apple promotes its own services. If it gives them preferential placement in the App Store, for instance, it would draw much bigger audiences. It already pre-installs music, TV and news apps, guaranteeing its services wide distribution.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFILE PHOTO: Apple TV is pictured at an Apple Store in Los Angeles, California October 30, 2015.

The EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager has already suggested that this puts Apple beyond the reach of competition enforcement.The second question is the extent to which Apple\u2019s services benefit from preferential ties to the company\u2019s software platform.Apple Music, for instance, can already be launched by voice command, using Siri \u2014 a feature not available to rival music apps. Apple\u2019s own payment system is the only one that can be used simply by waving an iPhone over a payment terminal.The developer conference is a chance to show off the latest capabilities built into Apple\u2019s software platform.\u00a0The extent to which these are reserved for Apple\u2019s own services, as opposed to third party apps, is not something that the company will want to draw attention to.\u00a0But that will be a key consideration as Apple\u2019s interests, and those of developers, increasingly diverge."},

Most Google mobile apps are banned in China, where alternatives are offered by domestic competitors such as Tencent and Baidu.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementBut the move will hugely damage the brand's appeal to consumers outside China.Almost half of the 208 million phones Huawei shipped in 2018 went to outside mainland China, and Europe is the most important overseas market where its devices currently have 29 per cent market share, according to technology research firm IDC.\"Having those apps is critical for smartphone makers to stay competitive in regions like Europe,\" said Geoff Blaber, vice president of research, CCS Insight.The business ban may also affect Huawei\u2019s 5G plans.\u201c(It) may cause China to delay its 5G network build until the ban is lifted, having an impact on many global component suppliers,\" said Ryan Koontz, a Rosenblatt Securities analyst.WHAT CAN HUAWEI DO?To get around the Google ban, Huawei would ultimately have to build its own operating system, as Apple has for its iPhones. That cannot be done in a hurry.Software developers might feel compelled to offer a Huawei-specific version of their apps. Or the Chinese manufacturer could start a new branch of the Android family based on the open source version available now.But that will all take time.ARE THERE RISKS FOR GOOGLE?The widespread mobile usage of Maps, Gmail and Google's other services has helped the US company build a market-leading position with Android alongside its crushing dominance in desktop browsing.But in cutting off Huawei, Google risks being deprived of the revenue-generating data of all those phone owners around the world.And other Chinese smartphone makers, such as Xiaomi, Oppo and OnePlus, will be watching closely.Should Huawei build its own system, it's conceivable that those companies might join it, in a bid to end their own vulnerability to future actions by the US government or companies.HOW DID THE BAN COME ABOUT?Huawei has been the target of an intense campaign by Washington, which has been trying to persuade allies not to allow China a role in building next-generation 5G mobile networks.READ: Trump declares emergency barring foreign telecoms posing security riskHuawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei\u2019s army background and his company\u2019s opaque culture have fueled suspicions in some countries that the firm has links with the Chinese military and intelligence services.The United States believes Huawei\u2019s smartphones and network equipment could be used by China to spy on Americans, allegations the company has repeatedly denied.\"Chinese telecom companies like Huawei effectively serve as an intelligence-gathering arm of the Chinese Communist Party,\" Senator Tom Cotton from the US Republican party had said after Trump's emergency declaration last week.WHAT\u2019S BEEN HUAWEI\u2019S RESPONSE?Huawei said on Monday it would continue to provide security updates and services for its smartphones and tablets.\"We have made substantial contributions to the development and growth of Android around the world,\" a spokesman said.\"Huawei will continue to provide security updates and after-sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products, covering those that have been sold and that are still in stock globally,\" he added, without touching on what would happen with phones it would sell in the future.READ: Huawei will not bow to US pressure, says founder Ren ZhengfeiHuawei previously said that the company has already been preparing a contingency plan by developing its own technology in case it is blocked from using Android. Some of this technology is already being used in products sold in China, the company said.\"We have not done anything which violates the law,\" founder and CEO Ren told Japanese media on Saturday, adding the US measures would have a limited impact.\u00a0\"It is expected that Huawei's growth may slow, but only slightly.\u201d"},

Our hearts are breaking for your loss,\" read one of the notes marked with a string of x-kisses.\u00a0When the police tape was lifted late Saturday, bystanders spontaneously joined police in moving the stack of bouquets further toward the mosque.An imam who was leading prayers at the Linwood mosque at the time of the attack said the Muslim community would not be shaken by the massacre.\"It was a very bad day, not just all of us, all of New Zealand,\" said Ibrahim AbdulHalim. But, he added: \"We still love this country.\"Across New Zealand, Kiwis responded with interfaith solidarity - crowdfunding millions of dollars, donating halal food and even offering to accompany local Muslims now scared to walk the streets.\u00a0It is eerily quiet outside #Christchurch Hospital, where dozens of victims of the #MosqueShooting are still being treated.

It is a signal to say - I am with you,\" she told AFP.Police are now trying to piece together answers to the difficult questions of why and how this happened.They also want to know how it was possible for the perpetrator to remain undetected by the intelligence services despite his extremist views.Ardern said the shooter was \"in possession of a gun licence\" obtained in November 2017, and he started legally purchasing two semi-automatic weapons, reportedly AR-15s, two shotguns and a lever-action gun the following month.Ardern said some of the guns had been modified to make them deadlier.\"I can tell you one thing right now -\u00a0our gun laws will change,\" she said.READ:\u00a0New Zealand PM vows gun reforms after racist Christchurch mosque massacreThe suspect documented his radicalisation and two years of preparations in a lengthy, meandering and conspiracy filled far-right \"manifesto\".He live-streamed footage of himself going room-to-room, victim to victim, shooting the wounded from close range as they struggled to crawl away in the main Christchurch mosque.Thirty-six minutes after the police received the first call, Tarrant was in custody.Commissioner Mike Bush hailed the \"absolute bravery\" of both police and members of the public \"who put themselves in harm's way\" to apprehend the suspect.\"Their intervention may very likely have saved further lives.\"Some of the officers involved in the operation were rural police officers who Ardern said \"put New Zealand first\".Two other people remain in custody, although their link to the attack is not clear.

And, inevitably, big firms can only be disruptive once.Celebrated physicist Geoffrey West once observed that cities exhibit superlinear growth, meaning that as a city gets bigger, every person there becomes more productive. However, companies exhibit the opposite trend.\u00a0Companies are nearly always killed by bureaucracy and administration crowding out creativity and innovation. Because, inside a company, \u201csomeone has got to take care of the taxes and the bills and the cleaning the floors and the maintenance of the building and all the rest of that stuff\u201d.Which is why, in the aftermath of the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911 into what became Exxon, Mobil, Chevron and other spinoffs, the value of what had been Standard Oil doubled within a year and then increased five-fold in the following few years. And, as with Standard Oil before its breakup, each internet giant\u2019s ability to innovate has already been hampered by its size.The internet is no longer led by the US alone. As digital applications spread into transportation, aviation, healthcare and energy, China is leading specific areas in artificial intelligence, advanced robots and e-commerce.\u00a0CHINESE INNOVATION\u00a0When I visited Shenzhen in China in 2018, a manager at telecoms giant Huawei explained to me that much of the city\u2019s infrastructure will soon be digitised and that the company will saturate it with a 5G network.\u00a0This will solve many speed issues and latency problems for computers using that network.\u00a0As a result, the amount of computing power needed inside a driverless car, for instance, will be massively reduced. That computing power can be offloaded onto the city\u2019s infrastructure by way of the next-generation networking system.This is a radical vision, very different from that of Intel in California, which is also hoping to dominate the market for driverless car technology by developing more powerful microchips to install in vehicles.

This induces us to attribute stellar performance to certain leadership skills.

The same is true in reverse of Steve Jobs\u2019 achievements during his two periods at the helm (1976 to 1985, and 1997 to 2011).\u00a0We can\u2019t attribute Apple\u2019s once skyrocketing stock to his tenure because we don\u2019t know what the alternative best-case scenario would have been.In my view, Apple\u2019s problems are primarily caused by external events.

A commentaryREAD:\u00a0What is the standout model in this year\u2019s smartphone shootout?Competition has been particularly damaging in emerging markets, which Cook is blaming on a strong dollar and weaker macroeconomic conditions \u2013 as opposed to any faulty Apple strategy in this part of the world.With respect to markets where the iPhone has enjoyed a more dominant position \u2013 especially the US \u2013 Apple recognises that customers don\u2019t replace their devices as often as they used to.\u00a0A recent report by BayStreet Research estimated that, while the average user upgraded her iPhone every 24 months as recently as 2015, by the last quarter of 2018 this holding period had jumped to 36 months.This is due to fewer carrier subsidies, according to Apple \u2013 but also, in my opinion, to the fact that the new devices do not have much more to offer.\u00a0I use an iPhone 7, which I bought in 2016, and I am honestly not inclined to spend US$1,000 for new features on a newer version. I already get much more from my current device than I need.APPLE'S PROBLEMIt worries me that Apple is a single-product company. Among its other revenues, iPad sales are one-tenth of iPhone sales eight years after tablets were launched.\u00a0By comparison, Samsung mobile phone sales only represent 36.6 per cent\u00a0of its total revenues. Wearables by Apple are not taking off either \u2013 and the company is not monetising its platform business by selling customer data to the same extent as digital rivals such as Google, Amazon and Facebook.The decline in Apple stock in recent months, down 37 per cent\u00a0since August 2018, reflects a change in market perception about the company\u2019s ability to grow.\u00a0Apple is no longer seen as a growth stock, but rather a dividend-paying, profitable company whose value is less based on a bright future than what is currently being delivered to its shareholders. The new financials confirm this view.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA customer looks at the\u00a0Apple\u00a0Watch\u00a0Nike+ Series 4 at the Orchard Road Apple Store in Singapore.

Today we blame the current Apple management\u2019s overdependence on a single product for the problems with investors. Cook and his team will respond by diversifying through acquisitions, or betting more heavily on new territories, or even staying put with its current product offerings.Whether this works or fails, the management\u2019s style of leadership will probably be disproportionately praised or criticised.\u00a0It is always easy for analysts to be wise in hindsight.\u00a0But the reality is that even the world\u2019s biggest businesses are more vulnerable to external forces than we like to think.\u00a0However the leadership reacts and, whoever is at the helm, the effect is actually quite limited.Arturo Bris is professor of finance at\u00a0IMD Business School and leads the IMD World Competitiveness Centre.

For starters, drafting readable policies better respects users\u2019 autonomy.\u00a0Beyond that, readability can contribute to better comprehension of legal texts. This, in turn, can make such texts more salient, leading companies to draft more balanced terms.But does this indeed materialise? In my\u00a0study with Professor Uri Benoliel from Israel, we examined whether, half a year post-GDPR, companies present users with online privacy agreements that are readable.\u00a0We applied two well-established linguistic tools: The Flesch Reading Ease test and the Flesch-Kincaid test. Both tests are based on the average sentence length and the average number of syllables per word.We measured the readability of more than 200 privacy policies. We gathered these policies from the most popular English websites in the UK and Ireland. Our sample included policies used by companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Google, Youtube, and the BBC.We had good reasons to be optimistic. The GDPR receives a lot of attention. It employs harsh penalties, which can presumably serve as effective deterrence. Additionally, the cultural convention is that Europeans generally tend to be compliant and law abiding.But we were disappointed. Instead of the recommended Flesch-Kincaid score of 8th grade for consumer-related materials, understanding the average policy in our sample requires almost 13 years of education. Almost all the privacy policies in our sample, about 97 per cent, received a higher than recommended score.LISTEN: That awkward conversation we need to have with Facebook, an episode on The Pulse podcastREADABILITY REMAINS A CHALLENGEThe European legislature thought that using plain language in privacy agreements can be part of a better, holistic approach to users\u2019 privacy.

But despite the GDPR\u2019s requirement, European citizens still encounter privacy policies that are largely unreadable.Does the GDPR just bark, but not bite? While it is perhaps too early to say, we located 24 websites in our sample that included their privacy policies as drafted pre-GDPR. We then measured their readability. The results show that current privacy policies are only slightly more readable than the older ones.This may offer some lessons. Most notably perhaps, good intentions and extensive legislation may not suffice.

It is our policy to concentrate all efforts into economic progress ... This is not the result of sanctions that have been imposed from outside.\u201dBonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that while the release was not an explicit precondition for the Trump-Kim meeting, the North Koreans understood that they had to do it for any progress to be made.\"The North Koreans have still said nothing to indicate that they are willing to give up their nuclear weapons, not to mention permanently and verifiably dismantle their nuclear programmes,\" she said.\"We have no clarity about Kim\u2019s intentions.\""},

Doesn\u2019t this remind you of Thanos\u2019 snap?\u00a0 \u00a0Now, will Instagram\u2019s attempt to hide likes solve our root problem or become another Thanos snap of the fingers?MORE LIKES, MORE LOVEThe prevalence of social media in our daily lives has changed ways in which people interact with each other.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n(Photo: Unsplash)\n                            \n\n                    \n                There are two basic reasons that social media users love to receive more likes.Likes are related to extrinsic motivation such as monetary rewards. Many influencers on various social media platforms make money by co-creating content with brands, and the number of followers and likes on their social media accounts determine how much they get paid.As brand marketers often relate the effectiveness of advertising with the number of likes, users often strive for more likes.Social media influencers can earn up to millions if they had a huge following. For instant, Youtube\u2019s highest paid content creator, 7-year old Ryan ToysReview, who has over 19 million subscribers makes US$22 million in one year, Forbes reported in 2018.READ:\u00a0So your child wants to be a YouTube star? A commentaryIn Singapore, influencers can charge hundreds or thousands for one Instagram post.Likes are also related to intrinsic motivation such as social approval. Since social approval with immediate feedback satisfies a very basic human need, users\u2019 self-esteem has become more dependent on likes.Some social media users take extreme actions to attract more likes.Last year a young couple died after attempting to take photographs near the edge of a cliff and falling from great heights at Yosemite National Park.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe couple at the Grand Canyon, in a photo posted on\u00a0Viswanath's Facebook. (Photo: Facebook/Vishnu Viswanath)\u00a0\n                            \n\n                    \n                Just a few weeks ago, another woman also died after she lost her footing and fell over the edge of a waterfall in California while taking a selfie.My earlier research suggests one of the driving factors behind the rise of social media is the desire to make a good impression for many people.People want to show off the most enjoyable moments of their lives and are encouraged to post more of such moments on Instagram when they experience that dopamine hit with each like received.This is why people take photos of delicious-looking foods, enjoying the sunset in a beautiful resort, or posing at exotic \u201cinstagrammable\u201d places. And the heart of such impression management and identify formation is validation from others, which the like button caters to.In face-to-face meetings, we can tell whether we have made a good impression by reading non-verbal cues such as facial expressions or body movements.However, on the Internet, it is not easy, if not impossible, to read reactions from the audience. The like button here then becomes a vivid expression of concurrence.HIDING LIKES WON\u2019T BRING BACK HAPPINESSLikes serve to give us a sense of our social approval ratings and popularity, regardless of whether we ourselves actually like using the button. Even if the count is visible to us, having this number be publicly visible is a vindication of our status.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n(Photo: Unsplash/Eaters Collective)\n                            \n\n                    \n                So when it\u2019s removed, this validation is taken away. Some users in Canada have said this cold turkey effect is tough to deal with. This is why removing or hiding the number of likes cannot bring back happiness for everyone.Hiding likes may remove the pressure for popularity, but at the same time it may also remove the joy of using social media.Although such an experiment is worth a try, a more holistic solution may arise if we better understand the fundamental desire of social media users behind this metric: Whether it serves an impression management tool, a reflection of social approval, a popularity indicator, or just plain fun.WHAT CAN HELP?What then would be an alternative way of resolving the concern regarding the likes? Stepping back from chasing after likes is one way.Perhaps, we can also learn from the history of constructive destruction.In his book on The Failure of Antitrust and Regulation, the late Yale University professor Paul MacAvoy argued that the constant efforts and huge investments by the US government in imposing regulatory and antitrust constrains on long distance telephone services in the 1990s did not lead to more competitors entering the market.Ironically, the long distance phone market became more vibrant, when wireless networks, a new technology, arrived in the late part of the same decade.To apply this lesson to today\u2019s social media, if users begin to find having the number of likes shown on their account hateful, Instagram risks the entry of a new social media platform that can minimise drawbacks but allow a more subtle way of expressing admiration to flourish.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n(Photo: Pexels/Omkar Patyane)\n                            \n\n                    \n                READ: An unhealthy culture of consumerism on social media is fueling anxiety and low self-esteem, a commentaryPerhaps Instagram recognises this and is trying to disrupt itself first before others can muscle in: One reason why it\u2019s doing away with likes.Still, it remains to be seen if such changes will help the platform get back to basics and rekindle the love of self-expression that made it successful in the first place.Or whether after it snaps its fingers, it will find new opponents swarming to take it down, just like Thanos did.Jung Younbo is associate professor at Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information in Nanyang Technological University.

Tourism advertising gurus could brainstorm for months and not come up with something as cheap or effective.It signifies the profound effect that social media is having on consumer markets, the rise of organic marketing and the phenomenon of \u201cunpaid influencers\u201d.READ:\u00a0What you get if you drink the Kool-Aid of social media marketing, a commentaryTHE RISE OF THE UNPAID INFLUENCER\n    AdvertisementAs a researcher, I am fascinated by this phenomenon, which sees everyday consumers (tourists, in this case) become advocates for the brands or destinations they have experienced. In marketing we call them \u201conline brand advocates\u201d. They are a brand\u2019s most authentic marketing investment.Tourism provides a textbook example of the way social media is blurring the boundary between media use and marketing.\u00a0With the selfie now the virtual vehicle for instantly sharing holiday happy snaps and proving \u201cI was there\u201d, platforms such as Instagram have become powerful dictators of what\u2019s hot.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n(Photo: Unsplash)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Each day Instagram users post 95 million photos and videos. Some of these posts, bound by a hashtag, inspire emulation.Selfie-taking has been embraced by Asian cultures. Chinese and Japanese social media users refer to \u201cASS\u201d \u2013 Asian Selfie Spots. Becoming recognised as such a spot can be a transformative experience for a local economy.But wait, you ask, has the chance to visit a boat shed really led someone in, say, Beijing, to book a ticket to Perth rather than Las Vegas?Another unlikely Asian Selfie Spot in Australia suggests it might have.This is Sea Lake, in northwest Victoria. It is one of the state\u2019s most isolated towns, and also one of its smallest, with a population of about 600. Its name comes from the nearby Lake Tyrrell, which most of the year is effectively a salt lake.Until a couple of years ago, Sea Lake was not on anyone\u2019s list of must-visit locations. But then some photos of what happens in winter, when the shallow, salty depression of Lake Tyrrell is covered in a few centimetres of water, changed all that.SEEKING AUTHENTICITYThe influence of platforms like Instagram was recognised reasonably quickly by commercial interests. It led to a whole new industry of \u201cinfluencers\u201d \u2013 social media personalities with large followings who take cash or gifts to promote brands.\u00a0Sometimes they are upfront about the fact they are being paid to spruik products; sometimes they are not.The influencer market worth is difficult to calculate, and 2020 predictions range anywhere from US$2.3 billion to US$16.6 billion.READ:\u00a0Taking wellness advice from influencers isn't a good idea, a commentaryBut even as it is reportedly growing exponentially, there\u2019s also a growing feeling that the paid-influencer market is perverting what social media is meant to be about \u2013 engagement with authentic storytelling.\u00a0Instagram has recognised this shift and earlier this year trialled removing \u201clikes\u201d and follower numbers as a means to limit people cashing in on their popularity.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n(Photo: Unsplash)\n                            \n\n                    \n                READ:\u00a0Instagram tests hiding likes but this won\u2019t bring back happiness, a commentaryAgainst the paid influencers, we see the rise of the unpaid influencers.

They were not expected to go into effect for several months.Beijing responded by vowing to take the \"necessary countermeasures\".\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementREAD: China outlines three disagreements in US trade talksThe developments came as two days of talks to resolve the trade battle ended on Friday with no deal, but no breakdown either, offering a glimmer of hope that Washington and Beijing could find a way to avert damage to the global economy.\"Over the course of the past two days, the United States and China have held candid and constructive conversations on the status of the trade relationship between both countries,\" Trump tweeted.\"The relationship between President Xi and myself remains a very strong one, and conversations into the future will continue.\"\n    AdvertisementThe tariffs on China \"may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations!\"Chinese Vice Premier Liu He told reporters that the talks had gone \"fairly well\", according to Bloomberg.The seemingly positive messages -\u00a0coming before the announcement that Trump had ordered the latest round of tariffs - had cheered Wall Street, which had been under pressure all week. The benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered from a loss of nearly 350 points to close with a gain of 117 points.US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Lighthizer met for about two hours with Liu on Friday and then headed for the White House to brief Trump, who had said he was in no hurry to reach a deal, arguing the United States was negotiating from a position of strength.FROM ANGER TO HOPETrump began the standoff because of complaints about unfair Chinese trade practices. The United States is pressing China to change its policies on protections for intellectual property, as well as massive subsidies for state-owned firms, and to reduce the yawning trade deficit.READ: Commentary: China has overestimated Trump\u2019s desperation to do a dealAfter weeks of rising optimism about the chances for an agreement, the tone out of the White House has veered from anger to nonchalance.On May 5, Trump erupted on Twitter, saying the talks were progressing \"too slowly\", accusing the Chinese of backing out of commitments and announcing the tariff increase.But in a series of early morning tweets Friday, he said there was \"absolutely no need to rush\".The US leader continues to argue that tariffs could in some ways be preferable to reaching a trade deal.\"Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind,\" Trump wrote.Economists stress that duties are paid by US companies and consumers and result in higher prices, while farmers and manufacturers complain about the loss of markets for their exports due to retaliation from China and other targets of Trump's trade wrath.\"NO ONE WINS\"\"NO ONE WINS A TRADE WAR,\" trade analyst Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics said on Twitter.Since last year the United States and China have exchanged tariffs on more than US$360 billion in two-way trade, gutting US agricultural exports to China and weighing on both countries' manufacturing sectors.The higher duty rates imposed on Friday will hit a vast array of Chinese-made electrical equipment, machinery, auto parts and furniture.\"While we are disappointed that the stakes have been raised, we nevertheless support the ongoing effort by both sides to reach agreement on a strong, enforceable deal that resolves the fundamental, structural issues our members have long faced in China,\" said the American Chamber of Commerce in China.Oxford Economics estimates the \"tariff punch\" from all existing duties will cut 0.3 percentage points off US growth and warns recession risks are on the rise. Economists in China estimate a similar impact.The International Monetary Fund has warned the conflict and the loss of confidence it creates will have a wider impact on the global economy and is a major risk to growth."},

It is not about aspiring to some absolute standard for protecting user data. Instead, what matters are the generally accepted standards of the time.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementBeing able to compare yourself favourably to a competitor who sets the bar lower helps. When things go wrong there is always a mea culpa to deliver and a new, higher ideal to commit to.This has become a tried and true formula for defending one of the most profitable advertising businesses ever invented. But for how much longer?FACEBOOK'S RESPONSE A 'TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE'Facebook\u2019s response to the crisis over the alleged leak of 50 million users\u2019 personal data has been a textbook example of how to deal with calls for more outside regulation of a tech company.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementFirst, concede you did not live up to the trust of users \u2014 without being too specific about how you failed. Point out that the problems are historic and you have already changed your policies to deal with them.Then promise some extra protections to raise the privacy bar \u2014 while not doing anything that will hamper a business model that relies on the collection and use of unprecedented amounts of personal information.READ:\u00a0A commentary on Facebook's floundering response to the data scandal.A PATTERN\n    AdvertisementA refusal to look to its own shortcomings squarely in the eye has been an essential part of this pattern. Even by the standards of Silicon Valley, where the past is another country, Facebook\u2019s ability to disown its own earlier practices can seem remarkable.Take a company blog post from late last year that brushed off prior failures to prevent users\u2019 data from leaking through third-party apps \u2014 the very issue at the heart of the scandal that has shaken the company this week.At the time, Facebook conceded it was \u201cfair to criticise\u201d its earlier shortcomings. But it also claimed credit for always having cared about privacy, along with the fact that \u201cin the past five years we\u2019ve significantly improved\u201d.\u00a0It was as though past mistakes did not deserve a further thought \u2014 no matter that, five years before, the company was already public and had just topped 1 billion users.It has promised to take a harder look \u2014 for the first time \u2014 at weaknesses in the past that might have led to other instances of wholesale mishandling of personal data. Given the intense political pressure this week, it could hardly not.But in all other respects, Wednesday\u2019s response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal looked like business as usual: Insist that you take the issue seriously, tighten some rules about the sharing of data, but do not do anything that might threaten the Golden Goose.This has worked with other privacy snafus. But will this time be different?INVESTORS SHOULD BE WORRIEDThe signals from Wall Street suggest it may. Investors have been worrying for some time about new regulations on consumer tech platforms, without anything specific to pin their fears to. Now they have it.All the big tech stocks were caught in a downdraft on Monday, but a bifurcation has been evident. Companies that rely on collecting data to support online advertising businesses \u2014 Facebook, Google, Twitter \u2014 have been hit the hardest.In one sign of the shift, Amazon\u2019s stock market value jumped past that of Alphabet, making it second only to Apple. For its part, the iPhone maker, with no advertising business to defend, decided to make its own, heightened commitment to user privacy a differentiator some time ago.\u00a0Like Microsoft, the company has fought a high-profile case against the US government to defend user data against unwarranted intrusion by law enforcement \u2014 a badge of honour at a time when other platforms are coming to be seen as promoters of private sector surveillance.ESCAPE AGAIN?The cynical view is that Facebook will escape, once again, with a ticking off and a promise to do better.\u00a0Unlike Brussels, Washington has shown no taste for privacy legislation. The Federal Trade Commission put the social networking company on a short leash seven years ago after a previous failure, but has done nothing to clamp down on it subsequently.\u00a0And while many users have expressed outrage this week, there is no evidence of large-scale user defection.History suggests that this storm, like the others, will eventually blow over. But with so much user data at stake \u2014 and claims that the inviolability of democracy itself may be on the line \u2014 the stakes have just got a lot higher.\u00a9 2018 The Financial Times Ltd.

Instead, their fame and credibility is derived from a series of techniques.\u00a0These include carefully constructed personas and narratives of self-transformation, documenting their journey from illness to self-recovery. The personal improvements they document online rest mostly on anecdotal evidence and photographs which reveal their transformation into attractive, ostensibly happier and healthier people.There is no commitment to independent testing procedures and results by objective, scientific methods. Rather, online metrics (such as followers, likes and shares) validate their status.\u00a0Lifestyle gurus connect and inspire their followers through disclosing their struggles and vulnerability.

Engineered around the quest for visibility and attention, influence is measured by follower counts and engagement.\u00a0An expert may have credentials and years of experience, but they are unlikely to be as compelling as an attractive lifestyle guru who is \u201cinstafamous\u201d, with a highly curated social media feed to verify their advice.\u00a0READ:\u00a0Highly sexualised images are shaping influence on Instagram, a commentaryThe issue here is not merely about the risk of misinformation, but the techniques used to influence us to decide what information to trust and who to believe.LOW TRUST SOCIETYOur trust in lifestyle gurus is a direct response to the crisis of confidence in institutions and professionals. We live in a low trust society where the very notion of expertise has come under scrutiny. In this context, lifestyle gurus use social media to present themselves as ordinary, \u201cauthentic\u201d, and accessible by positioning themselves as alternative authorities \u201coutside of the system\u201d.Gwyneth Paltrow and Kourtney Kardashian, for example, both of whom have created lifestyle sites, use their celebrity to give wellness advice and to sell vitamins and supplements.\u00a0Presenting themselves as our \u201ctrusted friend\u201d and equal, the whole business of monetary transactions is achieved as a form of mateship, as if everyone is on the same team, set against professionals and elites (despite their celebrity status).\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nReality TV star Kim Kardashian at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala.

In the past, food corporations and governments have acted unethically, experts have got things wrong, and lobbyists have influenced politics and research.\u00a0Non-experts can make important contributions to public debate, but problems arise when there is uncritical acceptance of influencers\u2019 views as morally superior, entirely trustworthy alternatives.Blogs and social media have democratised information, but they have also confounded issues around trust and credibility through altering how we seek advice and how we decide what to believe. It should be no surprise to discover that the low barriers to entry provided by digital technologies create conditions for deceit and exploitation as well as access and participation.\u00a0What is surprising is the relatively short period of time it has taken for lifestyle gurus to challenge experts by building relations of deep trust and intimacy with consumers.With over 200,000 followers on Instagram, a book published by Penguin and an app available on Apple, Gibson\u2019s message had legitimacy, influence and global reach.\u00a0Although she was eventually exposed as a fraud, she had been spreading misinformation for years beforehand.\u00a0The number of people ready to believe that Gibson knew more about how to treat her purported condition than qualified medical experts is indicative of the power of social media influencers to inform health messaging.Stephanie Alice Baker is lecturer in Sociology, City, University of London.

Trump acknowledged on Wednesday it was unclear if the summit would go ahead.\"It is true that there are differences of opinion between the North and the United States on methods to accomplish denuclearisation,\" Kang told lawmakers, according to Yonhap News Agency.Trump will host South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the White House on May 22.The Blue House intends to \"sufficiently convey (to the United States) what we've discerned about North Korea's position and attitude... and sufficiently convey the United States' position to North Korea\", thereby helping to bridge the gap, the official said.Asked if she trusted Kim Jong Un, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang said: \"Yes.\"Japan's Asahi newspaper reported that the United States had demanded North Korea ship some nuclear warheads, an intercontinental ballistic missile and other nuclear material overseas within six months.The newspaper, citing several sources familiar with North Korea, said US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to have told the North Korean leader when they met this month that Pyongyang might be removed from a list of state sponsors of terrorism if it complied.The Asahi also reported that if North Korea agreed to complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation at the Singapore summit, Washington was considering giving guarantees for Kim's regime.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, said the measures North Korea has taken to ease tension should be acknowledged, and all other parties, especially the United States, should cherish the opportunity for peace.Cancellation of the summit, the first between US and North Korean leaders, would deal a major blow to what could be the biggest diplomatic achievement of Trump's presidency.This comes at a time his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal has drawn criticism internationally and moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem has fueled deadly violence on the Israel-Gaza border.North Korea defends its nuclear and missile programs as a deterrent against perceived aggression by the United States, which keeps 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.The North has long said it is open to eventually giving up its nuclear arsenal if the United States withdraws its troops from South Korea and ends its \u201cnuclear umbrella\u201d alliance with Seoul.North Korea said it was pulling out of the talks with South Korea after denouncing US-South Korean Max Thunder air combat drills, which it said involved US stealth fighters, B-52 bombers and \"nuclear assets\".Speaking to reporters in Brussels on Wednesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: \u201cI hope that in the end common sense will prevail, and the summit will take place and it will be successful.\""},

Still, about two thirds of global soy exports are destined for China.In his Tuesday tweets, Trump said the \"massive tariffs\" currently in place will pay for government bailouts for suffering farms.Last week, he suggested the government could purchase the crops and send it as food aid to poor nations.In July 2018, the government unveiled a US$12 billion bailout fund and US farmers already receive about US$20 billion in annual assistance through various aid programmes.And the National Pork Producer's Council said last week it \"welcomes the offer of assistance from President Trump.\"\"We stand ready to work with the USDA to facilitate US pork exports as food aid to a number of nations,\" NPCC President David Herring said in a statement.Exports now account for 26 per cent of all US pork production, of which a large share is normally shipped to China.Trump on Tuesday called the US-China trade war a \"little squabble\" and predicted ultimate victory.\"We always win. We always win,\" he said."},

Its floundering response to growing public concern is a symptom.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementThe many faces of Facebook are part of the issue. At the centre, Wizard of Oz-like, is Mark Zuckerberg, whose lengthy public declarations are hidden behind a warm curtain of feel-good phrasing, like this from Jan 31:One of the most important things we do is making sure our\u00a0services aren\u2019t just fun to use, but also good for people\u2019s well-being and for society overall.The bottom line is unsurprising: Whatever the problem -\u00a0even self-inflicted -\u00a0Facebook is the solution.THE PROBLEM WITH THE CORPORATE RESPONSE\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementThen there is the corporate line.\u00a0As the Cambridge Analytica story broke over the weekend, this boiled down, bafflingly, to a Bill Clinton-style debating point about the meaning of the word \u201cbreach\u201d.\u201cThe claim that this is a data breach is completely false,\u201d posted Paul Grewal, Facebook\u2019s deputy general counsel, on Saturday, in an update to its announcement of the suspension of the accounts of all those involved (including, counter-productively, the whistleblower Christopher Wylie). He said:People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\n    AdvertisementIn the end, though, he deleted some of his other tweets on the question, \u201cnot because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in\u201d. \u201cI just wish I was better about talking about these things in the reality of 2018,\u201d he bleated.FACEBOOK GROWINGWe might all wish the same of Facebook. As it has grown, the group has become ever-more adept at lobbying and litigation. The Observer, which broke the story with the New York Times, says the network\u2019s external lawyers warned the newspaper before publication that it was making \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d allegations.But it remains surprisingly poor at deciding how, when and what to say about questions that are fundamental to customers\u2019 perception of the group -\u00a0and who should say it.Facebook has had time to prepare, after all. It first learnt of the allegation that Cambridge Analytica had broken its rules on using data from the network in 2015. However, Cambridge Analytica has denied using Facebook data in its model.\u00a0Facebook has more recently been assailed by waves of criticism \u2014 amply described in a recent investigation by Wired magazine \u2014 about its role in the crisis of fake news and election influencing.\u201cThe reality of 2018\u201d is now biting Facebook hard. There has never been a better time for Mr Zuckerberg to come out from behind his curtain and do some straight talking.\u00a9 2018 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

But so far the North has not given any public indication of what concessions it is offering, beyond euphemistic commitments to denuclearisation of the \"Korean peninsula\".Pyongyang had \"made clear on several occasions that precondition for denuclearisation is to put an end to anti-DPRK hostile policy and nuclear threats and blackmail of the United States\", minister Kim said.In the past, Pyongyang has demanded the withdrawal of the US troops stationed in the South to protect it from its neighbour, and an end to Washington's nuclear umbrella over its security ally.The minister also blasted US National Security Advisor John Bolton's talk of a \"Libyan model\" for North Korean denuclearisation.\n    AdvertisementIt was a \"sinister move to impose on our dignified state the destiny of Libya or Iraq\", he said. \"I cannot suppress indignation at such moves of the US, and harbour doubt about the US sincerity.\"The North has long said it needs nuclear weapons to protect itself against a US invasion. After giving up his atomic programme, Libyan leader Moamer Khadafi was killed in an uprising backed by NATO bombing.Minister Kim also dismissed offers by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo - who has visited Pyongyang twice in recent weeks, coming back the second time with three released US detainees - for US economic aid if the North denuclearises.\"We have never had any expectation of US support in carrying out our economic construction and will not at all make such a deal in future,\" Kim said.TIGHTROPE DIPLOMACYIn recent weeks, as well as an eye-catching summit with the South's leader last month in the Demilitarised Zone, Kim has twice met Chinese President Xi Jinping and Pyongyang has announced it will destroy its nuclear testing site next week.Analysts said Pyongyang was now trying to redefine the terms of the debate.\"It's a diplomatic tactic,\" Kim Hyun-wook, professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy, told AFP, calling it \"brinkmanship to change the US position\".\"It looks like Kim Jong Un was pushed into accepting US demands for 'denuclearisation-first' but is now trying to change its position after normalising North Korea-China relations and securing economic assistance,\" he added.\"The classic North Korean tightrope diplomacy between the US and China has begun.\"US officials have repeatedly claimed credit for Washington's \"maximum pressure\" policy for bringing Pyongyang to the negotiating table.Joshua Pollack of the Middlebury Institute for International Studies said Pyongyang had been irritated by the \"triumphalist tone\".\"The North Koreans aren't happy with what they're seeing and hearing,\" he said. \"There is still a yawning gulf between expectations for diplomacy in Pyongyang and Washington, DC.\"THUNDERSTRUCKEarlier KCNA denounced the Max Thunder joint military exercises being held between the US and South Korea as a \"rude and wicked provocation\", and Seoul said it had received a message cancelling planned high-level talks \"indefinitely\".The two-week drills started last Friday and involves some 100 aircraft from the two allies, including F-22 stealth fighter jets.Pyongyang's move was \"regrettable\", said unification ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun, adding it \"contradicts the fundamental spirit and purpose of the Panmunjom Declaration\".Hostilities in the 1950-53 Korean War stopped with a ceasefire, leaving the two halves of the peninsula divided by the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) and still technically at war.The North has spent decades developing its atomic arsenal and missiles capable of reaching the US, earning itself multiple rounds of UN Security Council resolutions, while Trump and Kim traded personal insults and threats of war last year.Relations underwent a sudden turnaround as Moon used February's Winter Olympics in the South to broker talks between Washington and Pyongyang.Washington said it will continue to plan the meeting in Singapore on Jun\u00a012, with State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert telling reporters it had received \"no notification\" of a position change by North Korea.The exercises were \"not provocative\" and would continue, she added."},

I wrote a story in the early 1990s, after the first Gulf war and the economic downturn, quoting experts who said company bosses had noticed a fall in costs from the resulting decline in travel and decided to make it permanent.Similar things were said after 9/11. Every economic slowdown produces the same statements.They have partly proved true. While worldwide airline passenger numbers levelled out during these crises before taking off again, figures from the UK Office for National Statistics and Airlines of America show that business travel has been in decline for decades.Coronavirus may give this decline another push, but there is an irreducible minimum of travel that business people need to do and that is unlikely to disappear. Corporate travel will return for four reasons.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement1. FACE-TO-FACE INTERACTIONS STILL TRUMP VIDEO CONFERENCINGFirst, it is hard to establish a business relationship with someone you have never met in person. Basic video conferencing, over Zoom or a competing system, is fine.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Can vitamin C really help with your cold or even COVID-19?READ:\u00a0Commentary: The biggest work-from-home exercise may have just begun.

There is more ease, a better sense of who the other person is, shared jokes \u2014 and a greater chance of winning more business.For bigger groups, video, no matter how advanced, just isn\u2019t good enough.I spend much of my time delivering courses for the Financial Times\u2019s executive education arm.

You can\u2019t sense the change in breathing and eye contact when people are more or less interested. You aren\u2019t sure where the laughs come from, or why.2. TRADE SHOWS WILL CONTINUE TO DRAW CROWDSSecond, while companies grumble about the expense of stands at trade shows, they are an effective way of meeting crowds of potential customers.For smaller companies especially, trade shows save having to make dozens of separate trips.When I spoke at the Mipim property fair in Cannes some years back (this year\u2019s has been postponed), I was struck by how many European regions, British counties and secondary cities were using the event to reach investors who might not otherwise have bothered with them.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Singapore Airshow in a COVID-19 outbreak \u2013 smaller but not quiteREAD:\u00a0Commentary: Hit hard by COVID-19, Singapore Airlines may need to pursue deeper capacity cutsTrade fair statistics are hard to come by but Reed Exhibitions, one of the leading providers, launched 50 new events last year, bringing its total to 500.3. CORPORATE LEADERS NEED TO BE AROUNDThird, bosses will return to travelling. If you run a multinational company, or even a small enterprise in more than one country, you need a sense of what\u2019s happening around your business.Making acquisitions of companies you haven\u2019t walked around and whose products you have never picked up leads to bad mistakes.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nTwo colleagues in a discussion.\u00a0(Photo: Unsplash)\n                            \n\n                    \n                And if the top people travel, those lower down do too, although often in less comfort.4. IT\u2019S A THRILL FOR MANYThe fourth reason business travel will return is that we are a restless species, always curious to see what\u2019s around the corner.For all the grumbling business travellers do, there is still that thrill of setting off for a favourite city or for somewhere new.\u00a0The business travellers will be back.BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the novel coronavirus and its developmentsDownload\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegram\u00a0"},

Americans being targeted by Russians aren\u2019t just sitting ducks \u2013 they have innate skills, if they remember to use them.RECIPROCATE THOUGHTFULLYResearch on influence and its abuse shows how persuasion works and focuses on principles such as reciprocity \u2013 the act of returning favours and things like gifts for mutual benefit. This can be a small gesture, like friends taking turns buying drinks for each other.\u00a0Online, it could be even smaller: Seeing someone share your post or respond to a comment you made can cause you to want to reply or like the post on their page.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n(Photo: Unsplash/Con Karampelas)\n                            \n\n                    \n                To avoid being duped, check things out before you reciprocate. If you and another person in an online group are interacting in public view \u2013 sharing posts and making and liking comments \u2013 it\u2019s probably fine.\u00a0But if they then send you a direct message asking for a favour or to run an errand, keep your wits about you. You still have no idea who they are, what they do for work, what their name might be or even what country they live in.Be especially cautious if they, for instance, ask you to wear a Santa Claus suit and a mask of Donald Trump\u2019s face around your city.\u00a0At least one American did this, according to the Mueller report.\u00a0Consider Skyping them first, or seeing if they can speak to you without the aid of Google Translate or if their voice matches the gender they state on their profile.BE SCEPTICALThe Russian government also targeted close-knit communities with strong senses of shared identity, which scholars call \u201coneness\u201d.\u00a0They created online groups and pages that pretended to support and participate in the Black Lives Matter movement and the LGBTQ communities.It\u2019s clear that any identity-based online group could prove an easy target, so be careful when joining and affiliating with them, especially if you do not personally know the organisers in real life.READ:\u00a0Beware the culture warriors of social media, a commentaryThere are so many different situations where influence techniques could exploit aspects of human nature that it\u2019s impossible to outline all the potential scenarios.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement, Patrisse Cullors, tweeted that she had complained to Facebook and Twitter about numerous fake accounts (Photo: AFP/KENA BETANCUR)\n                            \n\n                    \n                In his book Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion,\u00a0psychologist Robert Cialdini offers a general rule to help defend against being swept into an influence campaign: Be on guard if you have a feeling of liking a contact more quickly, or more deeply, than you would have expected.\u00a0Simply put, trust warnings from your gut if you\u2019re starting to notice things are moving really quickly with someone you barely know. That\u2019s especially true if this is an online friend, and even more so if the person regularly posts images of identity-based memes.In an age where the seeds of global political instability are sown by exploiting social media and interpersonal trust, it\u2019s more important than ever to be sceptical of people you connect with \u2013 not only online, but in line at Starbucks.Jennifer Grygiel is\u00a0assistant professor of communications (social media) & magazine, news and digital journalism at\u00a0Syracuse University.\u00a0This commentary first appeared on The Conversation.

The company\u2019s modern, fuel efficient planes \u2013 alongside its ability to fill them with passengers \u2013 does make it the \u201cgreenest\u201d air travel option out there.However, Ryanair had a total of 450 planes in operation in 2019 (compared to only 250 in 2010) \u2013 meaning that despite its fuel-efficient planes, the sheer quantity of fuel they burn is why they were named one of Europe\u2019s top ten polluting companies in 2019.CARBON OFFSETSLast year also saw carbon offset schemes become popular. These schemes allow passengers to pay extra so their airline can invest in environmental projects on their behalf \u2013 thereby making a flight theoretically \u201ccarbon-neutral\u201d.British Airways now offsets all of its customers\u2019 domestic UK flights, while Ryanair also has a scheme allowing passengers to buy offsets for their flights, with proceeds going to projects including a whale protection scheme \u2013 which appears completely unconnected to reducing carbon.READ: Commentary: Forget bamboo straws. Let\u2019s name the elephants in the room of Singapore\u2019s climate debateEasyjet has also started buying offsets on behalf of all its passengers \u2013 costing a total of \u00a325\u00a0million (US$33 million) a year.This has apparently been a successful PR move, with internal research finding that passengers who were aware of the offsetting policy were more satisfied with their flight than customers who didn\u2019t know.ARE CARBON OFFSETS EFFECTIVE?Passengers might feel satisfied, but whether their offsets actually reduce carbon is less clear.Critics question the time-lag associated with offsets, especially tree-planting schemes. A plane that flies today pollutes today \u2013 but a tree planted today won\u2019t remove carbon for years.As for \u201cavoided deforestation\u201d projects, which aim to protect existing trees, proving these trees wouldn\u2019t have survived without offset funding is almost impossible.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFILE PHOTO: Billows of smoke rise over a deforested plot of the Amazon jungle in Porto Velho, Rondonia State, Brazil, August 24, 2019.

For example, Easyjet only invests \u00a33 per tonne of carbon it emits in a carbon offset scheme.But such a low-ball investment might not even be able to give these carbon offset schemes the finances needed to actually offset the effects of one tonne of carbon.For context, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme currently trades carbon at \u00a321 a tonne, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change thinks carbon should be traded at a minimum of \u00a3105 a tonne.Newer, and more expensive offset models \u2013 which extract carbon directly from the air look promising \u2013 but are hard to scale up.READ: Commentary: That low-carbon future for Singapore isn\u2019t so far-fetchedThe other danger of these cheap offsets is that travellers might believe they solve the problems caused by flying \u2013 so they won\u2019t change their travel behaviour. Indeed, one government minister even argues that there\u2019s no need for people to fly less, because low-carbon and electric flights are around the corner.Despite reports that solar or battery-powered planes are coming to the rescue, current plane technology is going nowhere fast.This is partly because jet fuel on international flights isn\u2019t taxed, which leaves little financial incentive for the industry to invest in big technological shifts.Aircraft manufacturers Boeing even predicts it will produce 44,000 planes by 2038 to accommodate the 8 billion passengers flying each year by then. Those planes will look, sound and pollute much like today\u2019s ones.READ: Commentary: The future of aviation?

He took to YouTube in 2011 and his earnings from his more than 1.4 million subscribers and close to 327 million video views are estimated at around US$10,000 a month.\u00a0That\u2019s likely a large underestimate of his total take: \u201cRight Click\u201d reports that Watson, who started broadcasting from his mother\u2019s basement, now has a very big flat in London.Watson launches himself against such targets as the Harry Potter creator J\u00a0K\u00a0Rowling, showing pictures of her three \u201cmansions\u201d \u2013 in the Scottish Highlands, in Edinburgh and in Tasmania \u00ad\u2013 and mocking her for calling for the UK to welcome more migrants, while hosting none of them in her homes.\u00a0Watson defends the pro-Trump actor James Woods, who was temporarily shut out of Twitter in September for posting a satirical meme claiming that Democrats were advising them not to vote in next month\u2019s midterm elections in order to increase the power of women's vote \u2013 a claim, Watson said, which was an obvious joke that only a \"complete idiot\" would take seriously.The status of the joke is central to this strain of politics (and politics, serious politics, it is).\u00a0POLITICAL CORRECTNESSMark Meechan, who works under the name of Count Dankula, posted in 2016 a video of his girlfriend's pug dog sitting, with one paw held rigidly out from its body.

He was not, he insisted, a racist. His action was a joke \u2013 first, on his girlfriend and, second, on everyone else.Much of what I have seen and heard from these new world commentators I thought reasonable debate. Some share some of the ideas and aversions of more mainstream commentators, who insist they are \"classical liberals.\"\u00a0Much of what they say and broadcast is akin to mere anti-political correctness, and the highlighting of cases where liberals object to conservative speakers being given a platform.But a Hitler-saluting pug? Doing his trick on the prompt to kill Jews?\u00a0Shouldn\u2019t that be banned? Unlike the United States, the UK doesn\u2019t have the constitutionally-protected right to free speech that allows nearly all comments described as \u201chate.\u201d\u00a0I would follow the Americans in this, in the belief that suppression even of a heinous statement gives it a wind at its back. But Count Dankula tests that position to a limit.POLITICAL CULTURE WARThe matter is not confined to the cultural world, nor to a corner of politics.\u00a0The BBC radio show reported that 92 per cent of under-25s got their news and views from the internet, as did 62 per cent of those aged 25 to 35.\u00a0They, said the programme\u2019s presenter, Gavin Hayes, are the \u201ciceberg coming.\u201dAnd the present? Last weekend, the Christian Social Union (CSU) lost its position as the hegemonic party of the southern German state of Bavaria.\u00a0The CSU is part of the governing coalition led by Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2013 as are the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), who also did very badly in Bavaria.\u00a0Though the CSU remains the largest party, it lost support to the far-right Alternative fur Deutschland and the leftist Greens, neither strong forces in Bavaria till now.\u00a0READ:\u00a0'We first', from Brazil to Bosnia, the divisive politics of confrontation, a commentary\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nTop candidate of the ecologist Greens party in Bavaria Ludwig Hartmann (L) and co-leader of the Greens Robert Habeck (R) crowd-surf with jubilant supporters of the party that ran on the motto \"heart, not hate\" (Photo: AFP/Sven Hoppe)\n                            \n\n                    \n                The fragmentation of politics and the rapid decline of the mainstream parties has been already visible at the national level in Germany \u2013 as it is in France, Italy, the UK and Sweden.It\u2019s not fanciful to say that the denizens of social media have a large part to play in this.\u00a0The political culture war, between a part of the left and the media which have become intolerant and censoring of sharp debate, and a part of the right determined to test the boundaries of speech and humour, spills over into political choice. It forms many, especially the young, into opposing armies.And if it becomes an even more powerful force in the news media, it will course through our politics like a hurricane, destroying old media and the politics that went with them \u2013 and creating a new political landscape which we can only now glimpse.John Lloyd co-founded the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford.

The fact that he could not prove conspiracy with Russia does not mean it did not exist. Courtesy of the special counsel, there is more than enough prima facie evidence to pursue many investigations into the Trump Organisation\u2019s business dealings.\n    AdvertisementLikewise, Mr Mueller proved the Russians interfered in the 2016 election \u2014 as they have tried to do in other democracies.

The first will be the backlash. Never mind that Mr Mueller\u2019s report did not \u201cexonerate\u201d Mr Trump. That word will now go viral.It is likely the full Mueller report will contain damaging revelations about Mr Trump\u2019s misconduct. So far we only have the word of William Barr, the attorney-general, who was appointed by Mr\u00a0Trump with his own security in mind. But no amount of circumstantial evidence will overshadow the report\u2019s key finding.It was said that Mr Mueller\u2019s appointment was the worst day in Mr Trump\u2019s presidency. Mr Mueller\u2019s report is arguably the best.\u00a0Mr Trump will believe he now has full licence to escalate his attacks on the \u201cfake news media\u201d. In light of Mr Mueller\u2019s conclusions, Mr Trump might be making fewer complaints about the \u201cdeep state\u201d, however.HOW TO STOP ANOTHER VICTORY?The second problem for Democrats is understanding what was behind Mr Trump\u2019s victory so they can stop it from happening again. The reasons are as complex as faith in a Mueller \u201chail Mary pass\u201d was simple.They include the woodenness of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, the FBI\u2019s decision to reopen her email investigation 11 days before the election, disgust with run-of-the-mill politics, middle America\u2019s economic gloom and Mr Trump\u2019s appeals to the so-called \u201cdeplorables\u201d.

Moreover, Mr Barr\u2019s take on Mr Mueller\u2019s findings cannot be taken at face value: Mr Trump attempted to obstruct justice in full public view. Democrats are therefore right to demand publication of the report.But they would be wise to graduate from what conservatives call \u201cTrump derangement syndrome\u201d. There is a dose of truth in that critique too. If Mr Trump is true to form, he will now stoke \u201cTDS\u201d as much as he can. It will help his re-election campaign.\u00a0READ: Impeach Trump? It\u2019s about math, party and the public interest, a commentaryThe question Democrats must answer is whether they can hold the Trump administration to account without being swallowed by their personal revulsion for the president. They must also brace for a sustained backlash.\u00a0Mr Trump has been chafing at the investigation since he took office. As the saying goes, when you strike at the king make sure to kill him.

So if you calculate the case/fatality rate that way, it is going to be very high,\" said Cecile Viboud, an epidemiologist at the National Institutes of Health in the United States.Whatever the reliability of official figures, Iran is certainly one of the main centres of contamination outside China.The situation is aggravated by an economic crisis, as the country grapples with the effect of Washington re-imposing sanctions in 2018 - a move that hit oil exports and provoked a recession.\"Why did Iran not stop flights to China? There is a rational explanation -\u00a0China is one of the last countries buying their oil. They need to maintain the economic link,\" Coville said.\"With the sanctions, we can say that the government has lost at least 30 per cent of its budget revenues. This has inevitably had an impact on their health system,\" he added.Situated at a geographical crossroads in the Middle East and surrounded by countries with creaking infrastructure and challenging humanitarian conditions, Iran's situation gives cause for worry.\"This is concerning, both for public health in Iran itself, and because of the high likelihood for outward dissemination of the epidemic to neighbouring countries with lower capacity to respond to infectious diseases epidemics\", the Canadian study concluded.Azerbaijan, Iraq, Canada, Georgia, Lebanon, New Zealand and Qatar have now confirmed coronavirus infections among people arriving from Iran.Iranian authorities have taken measures to counter the virus' spread, including cancelling Friday prayers in several cities, closing schools until at least Tuesday, shutting parliament until \"further notice\" and restricting travel within the country.BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of novel coronavirus\u00a0and its developmentsDownload our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegram"},

A social media influence and infiltration operation led by the Internet Research Agency (IRA);2.\u00a0A cyber hacking operation carried out by the Russian military intelligence (GRU); and3. An infiltration operation of the Trump campaign.The report describes in stunning detail the inner workings of the full Russian operation.\u00a0\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementTo date, the report is the most comprehensive account (in addition to the previously released indictment of IRA and GRU operatives) of how the Russian operation evolved over time, how successful it was in targeting and duping Americans, and the Kremlin\u2019s motivation.READ: Instead of clarity, Mueller's report has created more headaches for US politics, a commentaryRUSSIAN TACTICS EVOLVED OVER TIMEThe IRA\u2019s first step was to build a network of accounts. Its social media activities started in 2014, seeking to create individual impersonation accounts meant to look like Americans, particularly on Facebook.\n    AdvertisementStep two was audience growth. The IRA did so by creating pages and content that were not necessarily political or even divisive, but simply meant to attract more eyeballs to IRA-controlled pages and accounts.By early 2015, the IRA had turned to audience-building around divisive social issues by creating social media groups and pages posing as US\u00a0groups and activists, such as \u201cSecured Borders\u201d and \u201cBlacktivist\u201d.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nWhite House Counselor Kellyanne Conway speaks to the news media about the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 18, 2019.

It was only once the IRA established its audience base that it turned explicitly to the US\u00a0elections around February 2016, with the explicit goal of undermining the Clinton campaign.\u00a0Instructions to the IRA read, at the time: \u201cMain idea: Use any opportunity to criticise Hillary [Clinton] and the rest (except Sanders and Trump \u2013 we support them)\u201d.Step four was a move towards promoting the Trump campaign while further building the reach of the content. The focus remained primarily on criticising Clinton until late spring 2016, when the IRA began to actively promote Donald Trump.At the same time, it aimed to further increase its audience by purchasing advertisements to promote its pages and reaching out via private messages to Facebook users prompting them to organise anti-Clinton rallies.INFILTRATION AND AFFECTING REAL LIFEThe IRA purchased over 3,500 ads and spent approximately S$100,000.\u00a0By the time Facebook deactivated the IRA accounts in mid-2017, the most popular group \u2014 \u201cUnited Muslims of America\u201d \u2014 had over 300,000 followers.By the end of the 2016 election, the IRA \u201chad the ability to reach millions of US\u00a0persons through their social media accounts\u201d on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Tumblr, according to the report.\u00a0Facebook later estimated that IRA-controlled accounts reached as many as 126 million people, and an additional 1.4 million were reached through Twitter.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nFacebook announced it would ban praise or support for white nationalism and white separatism as part of a stepped-up crackdown on hate speech.\u00a0(Photo: AFP/JOEL SAGET)\n                            \n\n                    \n                On Twitter, the IRA followed a similar impersonation and audience-building strategy by creating individual accounts that would post content, which bot networks would then amplify.As has been previously reported, US media outlets quoted the IRA-controlled accounts as representing real American opinions. So did members of the Trump campaign, including Trump family members.READ:\u00a0Impeach Trump? It\u2019s about math, party and the public interest, a commentaryThe IRA\u2019s intent from the outset was to use its digital operations to affect real life: As early as 2015, the IRA attempted to organise rallies on divisive social issues. The \u201cconfederate rally\u201d of November 2015 was just one of dozens of rallies that aimed to amplify socially divisive issues in the United States.It was only after June 2016 that the rallies focused almost exclusively on the US election and pro-Trump rallies.This tells us that the original goal of the social media operations, from 2014 to early 2016, was a straightforward, KGB-style infiltration operation aimed at polarising and destabilising US\u00a0society from within. Recall that during the Cold War, the KGB infiltrated environmental, civil rights, peace, and religious organisations.WHAT WE DON\u2019T KNOW, DUE TO REDACTIONSThe structure of the IRA\u2014perhaps the most interesting section\u2014is almost fully redacted due to \u201charm to ongoing matter,\u201d suggesting that the us Department of Justice could still be pursuing further indictments against Russian individuals and entities involved in the IRA operation.We know from the February 2018 us Department of Justice indictment of IRA operatives and entities, as well as independent reports, that the so-called \u201ctroll farm\u201d in St Petersburg focused on the United States was part of a larger interference project funded by Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin called \u201cProject Lakhta.\u201dWe also know that the IRA hired specialists for each social media platform, who were given specific instructions on which messages to push, how, and the performance quotas they had to meet.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nLogos of various social media platforms. (File photo:\u00a0AFP/Nicolas Asfouri/Lionel Bonaventure)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Yet, we still don\u2019t know the full scope of the command structure, how far into the Kremlin the decision-making process reached, and how the project continues to be funded today. Funding and oversight of IRA and Prigozhin is also almost fully redacted.The section on the IRA Twitter botnets is, interestingly, also redacted. This again suggests that further investigation may be ongoing into how the IRA established and used the automated accounts to amplify its content.The bottom line is that the Mueller report clearly shows that the Russian information operations were highly adaptive to the political context in the United States, followed a seemingly well-thought out strategic plan akin to a marketing or public relations campaign, involved direction from Russian intelligence, and were incredibly effective in infiltrating American media while influencing public debate around the 2016 election.Alina Polyakova is David M.

Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any political campaigns in its statement, attributed to company Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal.\"We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,\" Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA screenshot of Cambridge Analytica's website.\u00a0\n\n                            \n\n                    \n                Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 campaign manager, declined to comment on Friday.In past interviews with Reuters, Parscale has said that Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 Trump campaign, and that the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organisation rather than Cambridge Analytica.Facebook's Grewal said the company was taking the unusual step of announcing the suspension \"given the public prominence\" of Cambridge Analytica and its parent organisation.The suspension means Cambridge Analytica and SCL cannot buy ads on the world's largest social media network or administer pages belonging to clients, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, said in a Twitter post.MAKING AMERICA\u00a0GREAT AGAINTrump\u2019s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than US$6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records.Cambridge Analytica says it uses \"behavioural microtargeting\", or combining analysis of people\u2019s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the US population.It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and it is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups.Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica and two individuals going back to 2015.That year, Facebook said, it learned that University of Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data that he acquired with a so-called \"research app\" that used Facebook's login system.Kogan was not immediately available for comment.The app was downloaded by about 270,000 people. Facebook said that Kogan gained access to profile and other information \"in a legitimate way\" but \"he did not subsequently abide by our rules\" when he passed the data to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Wylie, who had by then gone on to work for\u00a0Eunoia Technologies. Eunoia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Facebook said it cut ties to Kogan's app when it learned of the violation in 2015, and asked for certification from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed.Although all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said that it received reports in the past several days that \"not all data was deleted\", prompting the suspension announced on Friday."},

Thus, Speaker Pelosi and her leadership team have sole discretion as to whether to proceed with impeachment.\u201cAn impeachable offence is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers to be at a given moment in history,\u201d said then Congressman (and later President) Gerald R Ford.Article II of the US Constitution states:\u00a0The President, Vice-President, and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment\u00a0for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.For a President to be removed from office, the House of Representatives first impeaches the President, and the United States Senate then convicts said President.By her words, Speaker Pelosi does not believe President Trump should be in office.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nUS\u00a0President Donald Trump talks to reporters as he departs to visit storm-hit areas of Alabama from the White House in Washington, US, March 8, 2019.

Speaker Pelosi needs to chart a path vis-a-vis President Trump that prevents it from becoming fractured.READ:\u00a0Remember, Americans like divided government, a commentaryWhile many Democrats favour impeachment, they also do not want the 2020 presidential primary season \u2013 now already underway \u2013 to be all about impeachment.

The Constitution requires a two-thirds super majority of the Senate to convict a person being impeached. Only then will the person be removed from office.Of the 100 US Senators, 53\u00a0are Republicans. That means at least 20\u00a0Republicans need to convict President Trump presuming every other Senator voted to do so (by no means a certainty).President Trump\u2019s latest approval rating from Republican voters as per the most recent Gallup poll is 90 per cent (n-i-n-e-ty per cent. Not a typo). Speaker Pelosi knows there aren't enough\u00a0votes to convict today. Thus, no practical reason exists to impeach the President. Impeachment minus conviction equals President Trump remains in the Oval Office.The House Democrats have two options when it comes to President Trump: First, impeach the President and he remains in office. Second, investigate, but don\u2019t impeach, and count on what is uncovered to best position the Democrats to win the White House in 2020.READ:\u00a0Warning - the US is now focused on the 2020 election, a commentarySpeaker Pelosi and senior Democrats have made the calculation that, for now, impeachment is not an option.

Democrats in the House will have no say in that process; Democrats in the 100-member Senate simply will not have the votes to stop any Trump appointments.But there is more to it than that.

The reason for this is not because Mueller will not come up with any major findings, but because he already has. And they have had little impact.Two situations in particular are the kinds of developments that would generally be described as a smoking gun: The evidence of the meeting Donald Trump\u00a0Jr\u00a0set up between Russian operatives and members of his father\u2019s campaign in 2016, and the convictions and indictments of several Trump operatives, most notably Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and campaign chair Paul Manafort.\u00a0However, these stories dominated the news cycles only briefly before being lost to other political controversies and Trump\u2019s insistence upon \u201cno collusion\u201d with Moscow.READ:\u00a0A guilty verdict for Manafort does little to hurt Trump, a commentary\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS President Donald Trump marks one year anniversary of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe insisting there was \"no collusion\" (Photo: AFP/Jim WATSON)\n                            \n\n                    \n                These events had very little impact not because they weren\u2019t important, but because Trump\u2019s supporters simply didn\u2019t care.\u00a0Trump has succeeded in making the Mueller investigation so partisan an issue that whatever Mueller has found, or will find in the future, will have little effect other than reinforcing existing views among voters and lawmakers.\u00a0It is unlikely that anything, even evidence of criminal activity, beyond the campaign finance violations Cohen cited in connection with Trump, will change this.TRUMP'S LOYAL SUPPORTERSTrump has never been a very popular president, but his support has been quite stable in the face of revelations that one might expect to influence public opinion.\u00a0From the time he was inaugurated through the recent midterms, according to Gallup\u2019s weekly polling, his popularity was always between 35 and 47 per cent, with fluctuations that were not particularly correlated to Russia-related revelations.\u00a0By comparison, for a similar period, Obama\u2019s ranged from 44 and 69 per cent and Bush\u2019s from 51 and 90 per cent.\u00a0Trump\u2019s numbers suggest that while he is never going to be well-liked by most Americans, there is a floor of about 35 per cent that is not going to abandon him.That base of 35 per cent is significant because it roughly translates into more than 35 Republican senators whose voters like Trump and will continue to back him.

The Hindenburg disaster may have condemned the industry to relative obscurity for almost a century, but it has never really gone away.The balloons of most modern airships are filled with helium rather than the explosive hydrogen used in the Hindenburg. Concentrated helium is lighter than air and when divided into gas sacks, the vessel can stay aloft if any are breached while propellers powered by flexible solar panels can help navigation.Extracting enough helium fuel will be energy-intensive and there\u2019s a looming global shortage. Luckily, advances made since the Hindenburg now allow airships to fly on cylinders packed with hydrogen jet fuel, which is cheaper, lighter, and relatively abundant.Using hydrogen for fuel has become a lot safer since the 1930s \u2013 so much so that it\u2019s now being considered for use in the home.

However, securing the 20-plus percent he needs to clinch the presidency, against the 4 per cent Bolsonaro needs, is likely too steep a climb.It will be the more so, since Haddad\u2019s reputation is not that of a strong leader, in a country which seems disposed to select one.Bolsonaro has invited comparisons with President Donald Trump and with President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines \u2013 comparisons which are, within limits, illuminating.READ: A Trump doctrine emerges - it is coherent but radical and wrong, a commentaryDuterte reached a large mass of people who had felt neglected, even despised, by liberals in power \u2013 and at the mercy of drug gangs and corrupt politicians and police.His ruthlessness in encouraging police to confront and kill gangsters, and to diminish or ignore human rights have been accepted, by most, as the price of greater security.READ: Almost a year in office, Rodrigo Duterte is far from the President he promised to be, a commentaryBolsonaro seems likely to emulate some of that. His backing comes from a broad swath of Brazilians, with support from the middle and upper classes who opposed Lula\u2019s efforts to help the poor, as well as some of the poor who are victims of the country\u2019s gangs and drug lords.Most damaging for the Workers\u2019 Party, most helpful to Bolsonaro, a vast enquiry into corruption \u2013 known as Operation Car Wash \u2013 revealed over the past few years corruption in every party, including the ruling Workers Party.

Following these temporary cooling periods our reconstructions show there is an increased probability of a temporary warming period due to the recovery from volcanic cooling.Earlier this year One Nation leader Pauline Hanson suggested that volcanic eruptions may be responsible for the recent rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nA volcanic ash cloud from Mount Sinabung hovers over Karo, North Sumatra, Indonesia June 9, 2019, in this still image taken from a from social media video.

With our new reconstructions were also able to quantify the rate of warming and cooling over the past 2,000 years.\u00a0Comparing our reconstructions to recent worldwide instrumental data, we found that at no time in the last 2,000 years has the rate of warming been so high.In statistical terms, rates of warming during all 51-year periods from the 1950s onwards exceed the 99th percentile of reconstructed pre-industrial 51 yr trends.\u00a0If we look at timescales longer than 20 years, the probability that the largest warming trend occurred after 1850 greatly exceeds the values expected from chance alone. And, for trend lengths over 50 years, that probability swiftly approaches 100 per cent.\u00a0So what do all these stats mean? The strength of the recent warming is extraordinary.

Expect more automation", "text": "\n\n                DAYTONA, Florida: In the wake of the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes of Boeing 737 Max planes, people are thinking about how much of their air travel is handled by software and automated systems \u2013 as opposed to the friendly pilots sitting in the cockpit.Older commercial airliners, such as the Beechcraft 1900, which are still in service mostly as small commuter aircraft, often do not have any autopilot installed.\u00a0\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementBy contrast, modern commercial airliners have automated systems that can augment or even replace pilots\u2019 performance, managing engine power, controlling and navigating the aircraft, and in some cases, even completing landings.Investigations are probing the possible role of automated systems in the 2018 Lion Air Flight 610 crash in Indonesia and the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash in March 2019.Regardless of those findings, the public may not know how much automation already is part of flying today \u2013 nor how much more automated commercial flight will become in the years ahead.READ:\u00a0We expected airplanes to be safe. Boeing undermined that expectation, a commentary\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementOur research has examined consumers\u2019 willingness to interact with automated systems on all types of vehicles, including aircraft. Most recently, we have begun looking into people\u2019s interest in what is being called \u201curban air mobility.\u201d\u00a0This concept involves a system of small two- to four-passenger fully autonomous air taxis that could carry passengers on short trips throughout cities without a human pilot on board.SIDE EFFECTS OF HIGHLY AUTOMATED SYSTEMOne problem that arises in planes that have highly automated systems is that the pilots can lose track of what\u2019s actually happening.\u00a0\n    AdvertisementThis is presumably what happened in 2009 when Air France Flight 447 crashed in the Atlantic Ocean on its way from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. Airspeed sensors failed, causing the autopilot to turn itself off, but the pilots weren\u2019t able to figure out what was happening or how to recover.Some experts also believe that a pilot\u2019s lack of awareness was a factor in the 2009 crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407 outside Buffalo, New York.\u00a0While approaching the landing, pilots may have missed the fact that the plane was slowing down too much, and again didn\u2019t realise what was happening until it was too late.Pilots who spend a lot of time in the cockpits of planes with highly automated systems may also lose some sharpness at flying planes on their own.\u00a0The average pilot of a Boeing or Airbus commercial plane manually flies the plane for between three and six minutes of the whole flight \u2013 mostly around takeoff, the initial climb to about 1,500 feet, and then landing.READ:\u00a0The Boeing 737 MAX 8 panic sweeping through the world needs a cure, a commentaryINDUSTRY SUPPORTS AUTOMATIONAirlines and manufacturers say they would save money and alleviate the current shortage of qualified pilots if they could reduce \u2013 or even eliminate \u2013 the number of pilots in the cockpit.\u00a0Redesigning the front of the aircraft to be more aerodynamic could save even more money, if it didn\u2019t need to have room for pilots, or could move them to another part of the aircraft.Several companies are developing fully autonomous aircraft, including Amazon and UPS, which want to use them for deliveries. Boeing and Airbus are designing self-flying air taxis, which would be used for flights of about 30 minutes and carry between two and four passengers, and have tested prototypes.A company called Volocopter has been testing autonomous air taxis in Germany since 2016 and plans to conduct test flights in downtown Singapore this year.

We have been among the scholars who have studied how willing people are to fly in self-piloting aircraft.Most of the results suggest that consumers don\u2019t know how much of aviation is already automated. Survey participants tend to think pilots fly manually much more than they actually do.In a study we conducted in 2014, people were much more willing to fly in planes with a human pilot in the cockpit \u2013 and quite unwilling to fly with either a human flying the plane remotely or aboard a fully autonomous plane.LISTEN:\u00a0The debate over the safety of Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX 8, an episode on The Pulse podcastOf course, some consumers are willing to fly in fully autonomous aircraft. In a larger study in 2018, just under 30 percent of US\u00a0consumers indicated they would be willing to fly on an autonomous airliner.\u00a0These are the early adopters, who tend to be people who are familiar with automation and view flying on an autonomous airliner as a fun activity. People who are happy about the prospect of increased automation also tend to be more willing to fly on smaller autonomous air taxis.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nAn American Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight approaches to land at Reagan National Airport in Washington.

Approximately 60 percent of passengers in our study said they were unwilling to fly on an autonomous commercial airliner.We believe that lack of knowledge about automation is one of the critical factors here, and that the public would feel better about automated flying if they knew more about the benefits of automation \u2013 such as extremely reliable automated warning systems to prevent mid-air collisions and crashes.WHAT THE FUTURE ENTAILSAutomation is not going away. In fact, by all accounts, it is becoming more prevalent in the cockpit. We fully expect autonomous flights to become commonplace in the next few decades.Despite the notable crashes involving autopilots, the industry as a whole appears to believe that the automation of the future will be safe, or at least safer, for the flying public. Human error remains the most common cause of aircraft accidents, and people are prone to make the same mistakes again.\u00a0They also may have trouble taking over from automation if the computers run into problems. Automated systems, however, can be reprogrammed not to make the same errors a second time.Large commercial airplanes will likely go pilotless later than smaller private aircraft, because of the amount of time and money required to produce them. But smaller air taxis simply are not economically viable if they require a human pilot on board.\u00a0As aviation automation engineering and technology continues to advance toward full automation, companies and customers alike will need to evaluate the risks and benefits, financially, in terms of safety \u2013 and emotionally.Stephen Rice is\u00a0Associate Professor of Human Factors, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.\u00a0Scott Winter is Assistant Professor of Graduate Studies at the same university.

We have stories to break; they are paid to make sure some stories remain untold. Yet our daily dealings can be quite cordial, even when we\u2019re not sharing wine and cabs. For one thing, PRs read our stories; it\u2019s hard not to like them a bit.Many also have a way with words and, as we drove through London that night, I remember my fellow passenger making a pithy, if mildly inebriated, observation.\u00a0\u201cMy job,\u201d he admitted, \u201cis to sow doubt.\u201dI remembered the times I had called him, looking to confirm a tale I had pieced together from sources far from the press office, only to be told: \u201cOff the record, you haven\u2019t quite got the full picture.\u201d Or the occasions on which he had dodged my probing by questioning my sources\u2019 knowledge, motives or very existence.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementSuch tactics tend only to delay rather than deter a persistent journalist, but there are times when delay means defeat. And these exchanges are so routine that I had not really considered that the PR might have the explicit mission of undermining my confidence in facts that his boss did not want aired.My cab companion had honed his skills in British politics, and his words came back to me recently as I sought to understand a challenge of more pressing concern to my trade: the fact that so many people in power have managed to brand what we do as fake.LESS THAN HALF TRUST THE NEWSAcross the three dozen countries surveyed for the Reuters Institute\u2019s latest Digital News Report, only 43 per cent of people say they trust the news. In countries such as France, Greece and Viktor Orban\u2019s Hungary, the figures are more depressing still.\n    AdvertisementAs with many subjects, one man hogs the headlines.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nNewspaper front pages reporting on President-elect Donald Trump winning the American election are displayed for sale outside a store in London in January 2017\u00a0(Photo: AP/Matt Dunham)\u00a0\n\n                            \n\n                    \n                According to the Trump Twitter Archive, the president of the United States has tweeted about fake news more than 200 times since his inauguration. He wields the phrase creatively, as shorthand for the entire media, as an adjective to append to individual outlets that offend him and as a weapon with which to diminish confidence in those who hold power to account.So the sources for one NBC story \u201cprobably don\u2019t exist\u201d, the man with \u201c@real\u201d in his Twitter handle claimed this month.\u201cWhy do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? Take away credentials?\u201d he mused in another tweet.These provocations can be relied upon to send journalists into overdrive about the First Amendment, but this misses a broader point. As Joel Simon, of the Committee to Protect Journalists, put it in February last year:They appear to be part of a deliberate strategy to undermine public confidence and trust by sowing confusion and uncertainty about what is true.If it is a strategy, it is working spectacularly well. According to a recent Monmouth poll, 77 per cent of Americans now believe that major news outlets report falsehoods. Worse, 42 per cent believe that journalists do so deliberately.Monmouth didn\u2019t ask how many Americans think journalists focus too much on themselves, but we mustn\u2019t forget that we are not the only targets of this prolific uncertainty-generator.A NEW RHETORIC OF AMBIGUITYAsked last summer whether he accepted that Russia had interfered in his election, for example, Trump replied: \u201cI think it was Russia, but I think it was probably other people and/or countries ... Nobody really knows for sure.\u201dRaising the question more recently of why he should not just fire Robert Mueller, the special counsel tasked with investigating if there was collusion between his presidential campaign and Russia, Trump similarly deployed his favourite suspense-keeping phrase: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d.As political communication tactics go, this is radically novel: We don\u2019t expect much straight talk from politicians but we are used to them rallying their tribes around simple, usually simplistic, certainties \u2014 \u201cmorning in America\u201d, \u201cno new taxes\u201d, \u201cyes we can\u201d \u2014 rather than hazy guessing games.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nSince taking office in January 2017, Donald Trump has made a habit of publicly bashing mainstream media outlets like The New York Times, which he regularly denounces as \"fake news\" on his Twitter account (Photo: AFP/Brendan Smialowski)\n                            \n\n                    \n                This new rhetoric of ambiguity can be dizzying, even for the faithful.Earlier this month, Neil Cavuto, a host on Fox News, said to the channel\u2019s best-known viewer:You\u2019re the president. You\u2019re busy. I\u2019m just having a devil of a time figuring out which news is fake. Let\u2019s just say your own words on lots of stuff give me, shall I say, lots of pause.As the world\u2019s most newsworthy man sows doubt, contradicts himself and overwhelms signal with noise, it can feel impossible to keep up. And that may be the point.More than a third of Americans actively tune out the news, according to the Reuters Institute. They are not even seeing the reporting that so aggrieves the president.So who gets the benefit of the doubt? I think that\u2019s clear.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the Financial Times\u2019s US business editor.\u00a9 2018 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

But I have an uneasy suspicion that Mr Trump may have the last laugh.\u00a0The 45th US president could yet go down as a leader who changed the course of history and embodied the spirit of an age.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementHistoric figures do not have to be good people, or even particularly intelligent.\u00a0Rex Tillerson, his former secretary of state, is reputed to have called the president a \u201cmoron\u201d. But none of that need stop Mr Trump from being what the philosopher Georg Hegel called a \u201cworld-historical figure\u201d.The quintessential world-historical figure of Hegel\u2019s era was Napoleon, whom the German thinker described as the \u201cworld spirit on horseback\u201d.\u00a0Oddly, the best definition I have read of what Hegel meant by that term, came from the current president of France. Emmanuel Macron told Der Spiegel that:\u00a0\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementHegel viewed \u2018great men\u2019 as instruments of something far greater\u2009...\u2009He believed that an individual can indeed embody the zeitgeist (world spirit) for a moment, but also that the individual isn\u2019t always clear they are doing so.I doubt Mr Trump has much to say about Hegel. But he may be the kind of instinctive statesman that Hegel described \u2014 a figure who has harnessed and embodied forces that he himself only half-understands.\u00a0By contrast I fear that Mr Macron, learned though he is, currently looks more like the embodiment of a dying order.A HISTORIC FIGURE\n    AdvertisementIf future historians do indeed decide that Mr Trump was a historic figure, what might they say?First, that he broke decisively with the elite consensus about how the US should handle its relationship with the rest of the world.\u00a0Previous presidents had either denied the erosion in American power, or sought quietly to manage it.\u00a0By contrast, Mr Trump acknowledged American decline \u2014 and sought to reverse it. His method was to use US power more overtly and brutally, in an effort to rewrite the rules of the global order to America\u2019s advantage, before it was too late.In particular, Mr Trump decided that globalisation, embraced by all his predecessors, was actually a terrible idea that was weakening America\u2019s relative power and eroding the living standards of its people.\u00a0After more than 30 years of stagnant or declining real wages, the American people were receptive to that message. Unconstrained by the politeness of his predecessors, Mr Trump bullied friends as well as enemies.With his instinctively zero-sum approach to the world, Mr Trump also decided that a richer and more powerful China was obviously bad news for America \u2014 and became the first president to try to block China\u2019s rise.\u00a0Whether or not this is a good idea, it is undoubtedly a historic development, reversing more than 40 years of American foreign policy, which has sought to integrate China into a US-led global order.On the domestic front, future historians might note that Mr Trump was the first president to notice the huge gap that had opened up between elite American opinion and that of the wider public \u2014 on a range of issues from immigration, to trade, to identity politics.\u00a0As a candidate and then as president, he ruthlessly and effectively exploited these divisions.\u00a0Mr Trump said and did things that conventional analysts regarded as political suicide. But his instincts proved better than those of the pundits.\u00a0Despite his age, Mr Trump also \u201cgot\u201d new media \u2014 and exploited it far more adeptly than other politicians.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe number of followers of President Donald Trump on Twitter has more than doubled since he took office, a new study found.

As Hegel pointed out, \u201cthe owl of Minerva spreads its wings only at dusk\u201d, which is a fancy way of saying it is too soon to tell.REGARDLESS OF FAILURES\u00a0However, from a Trumpian perspective, the early signs are promising.\u00a0The US economy is booming, while China\u2019s economy is sputtering. The US Supreme Court has been reshaped.\u00a0Under crushing American pressure, Canada and Mexico have agreed to rewrite their trade deal with America \u2014 and other US allies are showing signs of falling into line.\u00a0Whatever the results of the midterm elections next month, Mr Trump stands a good chance of re-election in 2020.Of course, it could all still go wrong. And, as an establishment kind of guy, I\u2019m inclined to think it will. The Trump trade wars could backfire.

As he explains:There were other things about Trump\u2019s skill set that I saw that you just didn\u2019t see with other politicians. For instance, he likes to focus on simple visual images. He\u2019s got the Make America Great Again hat. He\u2019s also got the wall.\u00a0He adds:Even without a photo, everybody could imagine their own wall. It\u2019s visual even without the picture. But then he added the pictures and it became even more visual.Adams goes on to say:Trump makes us think 'past the sale'. When he says, \u2018The wall will be 30 feet tall\u2019 and he visits the prototypes, he makes you think about what kind of wall it will be. That\u2019s thinking past, \"Will there even be a wall?\" It\u2019s simple and basic. But it\u2019s something that politicians don\u2019t do. And he\u2019s uniquely consistent in using these tactics. He didn\u2019t just get lucky.Trump made the wall another feature of this latest campaign, the supposed threat from a refugee caravan playing to the sharp politics of immigration.Rather than banal, Adams sees Trump\u2019s language of \u201csimplicity and repetition\u201d as a strength. Adams also talks about energy, illustrated by Trump\u2019s ability to short-circuit awkward \u201cgotcha\u201d questions of the type that would end another politicians campaign (think his comments on women, or the supposed \u201cwouldn\u2019t\u201d slip alongside Vladimir Putin).TRUMP'S SKILLS OFTEN UNDERESTIMATEDDoes this explain Trump as a phenomenon, a victory of method and marketing over questions of substance? Not exactly.\u00a0Clearly the issues he speaks to resonate, and Trump\u2019s style of politics is not bounded by geography. And in truth, the midterms are not really just about Trump, in spite of the attempt by both sides to paint it that way.What Adams' perspective offers, though, is more than comic relief.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nSupporters attend US\u00a0President Donald Trump's rally in Chattanooga, Tennessee, US\u00a0November 4, 2018.

This is an argument I have made for a year now.\u00a0So at the risk of belabouring the obvious, it should be pretty apparent now that Trump has whiffed twice in summits with Kim, almost certainly because of a lack of staff preparation and presidential commitment.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementIDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCESThe US and North Korea face a decades-old strategic and ideological divide.\u00a0The issues are deep-rooted and genuine.\u00a0North Korea is a terrifying country that treats its people barbarically. That is a powerful moral reason why so many countries hold it at arm\u2019s length.\u00a0The US also has a strategic interest in seeing South Korea hold its own against this Orwellian state. The South Korean constitution does not recognise North Korea. The US has stood behind that for decades.\u00a0\n    AdvertisementIn South Korea, Japan, and the US, there are many interest groups and actors with deep commitments \u2013 some of them ideological, many hawkish \u2013 on North Korea. So the status quo with the North is very deeply entrenched \u2013 for moral, ideological, strategic\u00a0and bureaucratic reasons.This does not mean that the US (and South Korea and Japan) cannot change or evolve regarding the North. We can, and perhaps we should. That is a policy and ideological question.My point, rather, is methodological. Changing the relationship with the North will require a major and serious effort.\u00a0The notion that Trump could simply swoop in and turn the allies\u2019 relationship with North Korea on its head in just a few months with a few meetings was always hugely provocative \u2013 all but guaranteed to produce a serious backlash from the many interested parties in South Korea, Japan and the US.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nUS\u00a0President Donald Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un walk in the garden at the Metropole hotel during the second North Korea-US summit in Hanoi, Vietnam February 28, 2019.

Trump even acknowledged this in passing at Hanoi, when he remarked that \u201cyou people would have criticised me for a bad deal\u201d.This bureaucratic resistance was fairly predictable, but Trump approached negotiating with North Korea as he has so many other major initiatives in his career \u2013 with a mix of bluster, laziness\u00a0and media over-exposure.\u00a0As with reforming health care, building his wall, or pursuing infrastructure building in the US, Trump showed once again regarding North Korea that he is just too slothful, impulsive, and disinterested in details to really do the work necessary for a major bureaucratic push.READ:\u00a0North Korea in 2018, a year of turning over a new leaf or worldwide gullibility? A commentaryREALITY CHECKRevolutionising US relations with North Korea may be possible, but it will take much effort.\u00a0Trump needs to use the \u201cbully pulpit\u201d of the presidency to sell this to the many sceptical parties concerned about North Korea. He has to try to bring these groups \u2013 US allies, Congress, the think-tanks and media, military elites \u2013 along and assuage their fears \u2013 that he is abandoning South Korea or Japan,\u00a0ignoring human rights and abductees, or bending on North Korea to get a deal from China, and so on. This might be doable \u2013 I am not actually sure myself \u2013 but something this big requires sustained, serious, public presidential leadership.And Trump just cannot do that. He is just too checked-out from his own presidency. He is too lazy, most obviously. He goes to work late, watches too much TV, does not listen to briefings, does not read, and so on.In the two years he has spoken about North Korea as president, there has been no perceptible improvement in his grasp of the issues. He is still grossly uninformed about Korea, nuclear weapons, and missile technology, and so wildly unqualified to go one-on-one with Kim Jong Un.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nNorth Korea's leader Kim Jong Un attends the extended bilateral meeting in the Metropole hotel with US\u00a0President Donald Trump during the second North Korea-US summit in Hanoi (Photo: Reuters)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Staff work would presumably fill in these gaps in presidential leadership, but here too Trump has undercut his efforts by throwing these summits together in just a few weeks.\u00a0READ:\u00a0Donald Trump, a truly historic president, a commentaryGiven how deep, serious, and complex the issues between Pyongyang and Washington are, it would be a remarkable bureaucratic feat if the relevant staff work could be done in a month \u2013 which is the time Trump gave his team before both the Singapore and Hanoi summits.LUST FOR RECOGNITION IS NOT ENOUGHPrevious efforts to engage North Korea involved months of planning (the Agreed Framework, the Six Party Talks), while the Camp David Accords, which brokered peace between Israel and Egypt, benefited from years of rethinking by all parties and serious, committed, focused US presidential leadership.\u00a0If Trump really wants something big such as that between the US and North Korea (so he can win a Nobel Peace Prize, which he apparently really wants), he needs to make a much greater effort, really learn about these issues in order to speak of them in at least some level of convincing detail, and lead a major presidential, cross-party, cross-ally bureaucratic and public relations push.He has not done that, relying instead on his supposed chemistry with Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. As should now be clear, that is woefully insufficient.It is now apparent that Trump will not mature into the presidency and acquire these skills. Hence the next step should be to kick negotiation with North Korea down to the staff level at the State Department.\u00a0Let the diplomats and technicians hammer out some small, workable trades with the North Koreans to build some basic confidence all around. Otherwise, a third summit with Kim will founder just as the last two did. Presidential whimsy and lust for recognition is not enough.In a normal presidency, the preparation for a further summit would see Trump learn the issues at least somewhat, work up a few trades with North Korea (aid for missiles, for example) which will enjoy some kind of consensus among the many interested parties, and then give some major programmatic speeches laying arguments for these deals with North Korea in the context of why a dramatically changed relationship with North Korea is a good idea.This is actually doable. US presidents launch major initiatives such as this all the time \u2013 George W\u00a0Bush\u2019s \u201cwar on terror\u201d, or Barack Obama\u2019s push to expand health care come to mind.\u00a0But Trump is just too lazy and disinterested, relying instead on these thrown-together-at-the-last-minute summits.

Manafort was Trump\u2019s campaign manager in 2016, though his crimes largely predate that three-month tenure.While Manafort\u2019s convictions are not directly related to Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, the impression that the Trump campaign was staffed by white-collar criminals is now much stronger.READ:\u00a0The startling fallout over Manafort and Cohen scandals will rock five countries, a commentary\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nPaul Manafort, US\u00a0President Trump's former campaign manager, arrives for an arraignment hearing at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, U.S., March 8, 2018.

When Yanukovych was ousted from office in 2014, that source of income dried up, forcing Manafort to find new and nefarious ways to support his lavish lifestyle.The problem for Trump is the possible nexus between himself, Manafort and Putin that Manafort\u2019s guilty verdicts could expose.That will likely be tested when the former campaign chair goes on trial in Washington next month for his alleged crimes linked to his Ukraine consultancy.Cohen\u2019s plea bargain also makes a possible charge against Trump more stickable. Importantly, Cohen has gone further than anyone else in directly implicating Trump as a co-conspirator in some of his actions.If Trump did authorise his former personal lawyer to pay off women with whom he had had extramarital affairs and told him to do so in order not to derail his 2016 presidential campaign, he may be guilty of campaign finance violations, at the very least.Together, the legal travails of Manafort and Cohen bring the Mueller investigation into the White House. It has so far just been banging on the windows.Trump has been able to skirt the malfeasance of his former advisors through the court of public opinion. The problem is that the United States is a government of laws and of actual courts that bully-pulpit tweets cannot indefinitely protect him from.READ: Trump denies wrongdoing, slams Cohen 'stories' on hush payments\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nUS\u00a0President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen exits a hotel in New York City, US, April 11, 2018.

He commits so many faux pas, is politically incorrect so often, skirts potential legal issues so frequently, that no one transgression ever seems to stick.Former President Richard Nixon committed one clear crime and paid the price. But what is Trump actually guilty of? Having dubious business and political associates? What US president hasn\u2019t had those?Sexual relations with women other than his wife? Bill Clinton did as much and is regarded as one of the most successful presidents of recent years.Trump\u2019s supporters also don\u2019t care about any of this. Many see the trials of Manafort and Cohen as the elite going after Trumps\u2019s associates because they can\u2019t land a glove on their hero.This popular sentiment is a vital currency for the Trump administration. He has thus far remained enormously popular with his base, despite the gathering legal clouds.\u00a0He is particularly adept at exploiting his victim-in-chief status. The most powerful man in the world is protected in the court of public opinion by his victimhood \u2013 a remarkable state of affairs.And another important point: There is still no clear crime that would make Trump impeachable.There is still not enough in the Manafort verdict and Cohen plea bargain to force Republicans to desert the man on whom their fortunes in the November midterm elections (and beyond) depend.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nSupporters cheer as US President Donald Trump addresses a campaign-style rally in Nashville, Tennessee on May 29, 2018 -- one of several he aims to hold ahead of November's mid-term elections (Photo: AFP/Nicholas Kamm)\n                            \n\n                    \n                American politics is about to become even more partisan and personal because the legal stakes have just gotten higher.\u00a0Are they high enough to end the Trump presidency, though?

Republicans, for their part, campaigned on the idea that Democratic victory would lead to socialism, or at least a devastating recession.\u00a0The Republicans ran on a slogan of \u201cjobs not mobs\u201d while scaring voters into believing that hordes of immigrants, funded by philanthropist George Soros, were preparing to storm the\u00a0country\u2019s southern border.\u00a0\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementOver all of this loomed the personality, tweets and rallies of President Donald Trump.BLUE WAVE NEVER CAMEThe impact of Tuesday\u2019s election will be far-reaching.\u00a0The new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives will be able to block proposed legislation before it can get to the Republican-controlled Senate, meaning that Trump is no longer free of constraints in Washington and that conservative bills have little, if any, chance of becoming law.\u00a0\n    AdvertisementThere\u2019s also a very real possibility that the House could vote to impeach Trump after the conclusion of the investigation into Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference or over possible business conflicts of interest.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nU.S.  President Donald Trump takes a question during a news conference following Tuesday's midterm congressional elections at the White House in Washington, U.S., November 7, 2018.

In addition, Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has unofficially begun and well over a dozen Democratic candidates could emerge as strong contenders to oppose Trump.Nonetheless, these unpredictable times still gave rise to predictable results. The Democrats were the clear winners, as the party that does not control the presidency has been in almost every midterm election since Franklin Delano Roosevelt was in the White House in 1934. (The exceptions were in 1998 and 2002.)\u00a0However, the blue wave that many Democratic activists were hoping for never came.\u00a0Relative to most other recent midterm elections, this hardly constitutes a wave.\u00a0The reason for that was the economy. The blue wave crashed on to the shores of the strong economy and the result could be called the blue splash.READ: Economic issues top of voters\u2019 minds in US mid-term election, a commentaryAN ORDINARY OUTCOMEIf you had been in a political science seminar 20 or 30 years ago and had been told only that in 2016 the president was a Republican and the economy was pretty strong, you would have projected this outcome, or something very similar.\u00a0Earlier midterms that drew much less attention and were not dominated by a president who reveled in confrontational and divisive rhetoric have had similar results.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nTurnout was far higher in the 2018 midterms than in the 2014 election (Photo: AFP/Robyn Beck)\n                            \n\n                    \n                This ordinary outcome to an election that was anything but highlights a contradiction between an American polity that by most measures seems to be in flux and voting habits and outcomes that don\u2019t always reflect that.\u00a0The Republican Party is transitioning from a traditional conservative party to a populist one, while the Democratic Party is finding new support in once solidly suburban communities.\u00a0A president who has broken numerous norms of American democracy and whose personality and behaviour has dominated the media for more than three years found that at election time, the fate of his party, like that of almost all presidents, was determined by an important, but comparatively mundane issue: The state of the economy.NO REAL LANDSLIDEIt is also apparent that for many if not most Americans, partisanship is still the main driver of their vote.\u00a0In every election this century, the popular vote has been relatively close with neither party enjoying a real landslide in well over 20 years.\u00a0I encountered this while speaking to voters in a swing district around Columbus, Ohio, in the final days of the campaign.\u00a0Democratic voters expressed a desire to restrain Trump, but most Republican voters simply explained their vote to me by saying \u201cI\u2019m a Republican,\u201d in the same matter of fact tone they might use if they were stating their preference for Ohio State\u2019s football team.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nA supporter is seen wearing a Donald Trump hat at Republican Governor Scott Walker's mid-term election night party in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, U.S. November 6, 2018.

They divided them into groups who read news stories about natural disasters \u2013 fires, hurricanes or blizzards \u2013 that either emphasised or omitted the role of climate change.READ:\u00a0Japan floods a warning of a changed climate, a commentary\n    AdvertisementCleverly, the researchers recruited participants from geographic areas most likely to experience the disasters they read about; for instance, participants in hurricane-prone areas read the news articles about hurricanes.

At the same time, the same articles made people who accept climate change perceive the hazards as more severe.READ:\u00a0Climate change needs better storytelling to address severe threats, a commentaryThe study findings suggest that reporting the relationship between climate change and hazardous weather may actually increase the scepticism of sceptics, even in the face of blatant contrary evidence.\u00a0Psychologists call this the boomerang effect, because the message ultimately sends people in the opposite direction.WHO'S HEARING THE MESSAGE MATTERSResearchers have tried a variety of strategies, including emphasising scientific consensus around climate change and describing the negative health impacts of climate change on people near and far, only to find that sceptics often end up more entrenched after reading attempts to persuade them.Messages can work when they use place to increase people\u2019s concern and willingness to act on climate change, but individual studies show inconsistent results.\u00a0One new study gave Bay Area participants maps showing the increased flood risk in their zip code due to projected sea level rise.

These participants may have replaced their abstract, apocalyptic assumptions about climate change threats with the more tangible predictions, causing them to feel less vulnerable.Another study, also involving Californians, generated slightly more success for place-based climate change news, but only among participants who were already concerned about climate change.\u00a0Study participants read news articles explaining that climate change would increase droughts either globally or in California. The global message made people more likely to want policy changes, while the local messages made people more likely to say they would change their personal behaviour.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nCalifornia's drought crisis has caused wildfires, decimated forests, threatened animal species and deprived thousands of homes of access to clean water (Photo: AFP/Justin Sullivan)\n\n                            \n\n                    \n                Place-based appeals often have some positive effect on people\u2019s willingness to act on climate change and environmental issues.But most studies about local messaging suggest that you cannot persuade everyone with the same message. A complex relationship of factors \u2013 including previous beliefs on climate change, political affiliation, and attachment to place and gender \u2013 can all play a role.Persuasive attempts sometimes backfire.\u00a0Messages about the local impact of climate change might actually replace people\u2019s abstract, altruistic values with utilitarian concerns.\u00a0In the case of sceptics resisting news about climate-driven disasters, the researchers from Ohio State suggest that these people are engaged in motivated reasoning, a cognitive bias where people force new and threatening information to conform to their pre-existing knowledge.MORE NEWS MAY NOT CONVINCEResistance to news about climate change disasters might be frustrating, but even the media often ignore the role of climate change in disasters, according to an analysis by the US non-profit consumer advocacy organisation Public Citizen. An overwhelming amount of extreme weather news coverage never mentions climate change.READ: School textbooks need to highlight the seriousness of climate change, a commentaryDespite low numbers, US\u00a0climate change coverage related to extreme weather and disasters actually rose in 2018, according to the report from Public Citizen. This increase aligns with a trend of news slowly improving its climate reporting.\u00a0For instance, US\u00a0print media has dropped some of the scepticism from its climate change reporting, both in terms of outright scepticism of the basic science and a subtler version that involved creating a false balance by including voices which both affirm and deny the reality of climate change.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nHurricane Harvey, which flooded these homes near Lake Houston, Texas, in August 2017, cost US$125 million and was the second-most expensive hurricane in US history (Photo: AFP/WIN MCNAMEE)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Even if the media continues to increase and improve its climate change coverage, it might not change sceptics\u2019 minds.\u00a0Of course, the media has a responsibility to report the news accurately, regardless of how some people process it. But those hoping that climate change news will convert sceptics might end up disappointed.Given this resistance to news, other approaches, such as avoiding fear-inducing and guilt-based messaging, creating targeted messages about free-market solutions, or deploying a kind of \u201cjiu jitsu\u201d persuasion that aligns with pre-existing attitudes, may prove more effective at influencing sceptics.In the meantime, social scientists will continue to investigate ways to combat the stubborn boomerang effect, even as the consequences of climate change intensify all around us.Ryan Weber is associate professor of English and the Director of Business and Technical Communication at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

However, the economic fundamentals are clear. Tariffs make things worse.\u2018BAD\u2019 TRADE DEALSThe erosion of American manufacturing became a hot-button issue during the 2016 election. And for good reason. Total employment in manufacturing has fallen by 25 per cent since 2001, putting about 4.5 million workers out of a job.Members of both parties now agree that free trade is largely to blame for this decline. Off-shoring and \u201cbad\u201d trade deals are cited as evidence that trade no longer serves America\u2019s interests.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementThe Trump administration\u2019s solution is tariffs. In recent months, entry barriers have been erected, first to protect solar panels and washing machines in January and then steel and aluminum in March.Although he\u2019s fighting these trade battles with many partners, including Canada and Europe, most of Trump\u2019s attention is directed toward China. He claims that China manipulates its currency, fails to protect intellectual property and stunts economic innovation. Sweeping tariffs \u2013 beginning with a 25 per cent increase on US$34 billion of Chinese imports \u2013 are an attempt to combat those issues.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nJust as Donald Trump was pulling the United States out of the Paris Accord on climate change, China was opening the world's biggest floating solar farm AFP/STR\n                            \n\n                    \n                READ:\u00a0Don't wait for a global recession to take trade war threats seriously, a commentary\n    AdvertisementTrump has said another US$200 billion in tariffs are ready to go \u2013 and that he\u2019s even prepared to tax everything China sends to the US.Unfortunately, there are several reasons to think that tariffs will only harm those Trump wants to protect.1. TARIFFS RAISE PRICES FOR CONSUMERSThe purpose of a tariff is to help domestic companies.\u00a0Tariffs are a tax on imports. As taxes go up, so do the prices of foreign goods.\u00a0Consider the metal tariffs. Foreign imports of steel and aluminum became more expensive overnight \u2013 to the tune of 25 and 10 per cent, respectively. Higher prices drive down consumption of foreign goods while bolstering demand for domestic equivalents.Unfortunately, protecting a few narrow industries can generate much broader costs. Not least, consumers now have to pay more for everyday goods.Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports affect a wide variety of basic products, from consumer electronics to shoes and apparel.That\u2019s not a problem for higher earners who can absorb the extra costs. But, for those with more limited incomes, who are especially vulnerable to tariff increases, price hikes can quickly gobble up take-home pay.Basic necessities such as food and clothing make up a larger share of working-class household expenditures when compared to higher-income families. And most of those products are imported.Foreign producers make up an overwhelming percentage of sales of many basic goods, such as shoes. In fact, one manufacturing industry group reports that 80 per cent of Walmart\u2019s suppliers are housed across the Pacific.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nCustomers shop at a Walmart India's Best Price Modern Wholesale store on May 8, 2018. (Photo: REUTERS/Mukesh Gupta)\n                            \n\n                    \n                One 2017 paper estimated that a 10 per cent across-the-board increase in tariffs on imported goods would cost the poorest 20 per cent of earners US$300 a year.That\u2019s a meaningful chunk of the less than US$13,000 earned by the poorest US households in 2015. Moreover, Trump\u2019s first round of tariffs weren\u2019t the 10 per cent used in the study. They are 25 per cent.And the president isn\u2019t stopping there. While the White House initially threatened a 10 per cent tariff increase on the next US$200 billion of goods he\u2019s targeting, officials are reportedly considering raising that to 25 per cent.Taken together, this means the real impact of tariffs on household incomes could be more than double earlier estimates.READ:\u00a0US-China trade war to continue on for years, not months, a commentary2. TARIFFS RAISE PRICES FOR COMPANIESTariffs also have negative consequences for American producers that rely on foreign inputs.The metals tariffs, for example, mean that manufacturers of cars, aircraft and tractors all have to pay more to produce their goods. Hence the vocal opposition to Trump from companies such as Ford and Boeing. Their costs are now going up, endangering their competitiveness.What this also means is that tariffs put jobs at risk \u2013 far more than they help protect.Trump\u2019s recent steel and aluminum tariffs were said to benefit as many as 400,000 workers. But 10 times as many workers \u2013 4.6 million \u2013 are employed in industries that rely on metals as a core input.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe trade war could soon get hot if the United States follows through and imposes tariffs on European steel and aluminium AFP/SEBASTIEN BOZON\n                            \n\n                    \n                The comparison is even starker for solar panels. About 2,000 workers directly manufacture solar panels in the United States. However, 260,000 work in related industries such as installation and maintenance. Those workers depend on a thriving solar market \u2013 a market that has stagnated since the tariffs.If one wants to count jobs, the numbers simply don\u2019t add up to a net benefit for the US economy.READ:\u00a0China could easily win Trump\u2019s trade war, a commentary3. TARIFFS MAKE IT HARD TO DO BUSINESS ABROADFinally, trade protectionism is a two-way street.Beijing wasted no time in responding to Trump\u2019s tariffs, announcing duties of 15 per cent to 25 per cent on nearly US$45 billion of US exports to China, mostly agricultural products. And more will be coming if the war escalates, with some of the highest tariffs being put on food products.Of course, targeting agrarian goods is a strategic decision. Agriculture is one of the United States\u2019 few remaining export-oriented sectors. And, since China is the second-largest buyer of US agricultural exports, farmers are particularly vulnerable to retaliation.\u00a0If a country wants to hit the US economy where it hurts, target agriculture. China did exactly that, hitting US producers of soybeans, corn, poultry and beef particularly hard.\u00a0As a result, agricultural workers will find it more difficult to make a living in a sector where incomes have historically lagged behind the national average of all industries.And poorer areas of the country will be harder hit than others. Three of the states that are the most vulnerable to retaliation \u2013 Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina \u2013 all have per capita incomes far below the national average.That means that poorer households, in poorer states, face the greatest threat if export-dependent agricultural companies can\u2019t do business with one of their most important trade partners.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nA worker packs bottles of soybean oil made from the US\u00a0imported soybeans at the plant of Liangyou Industry and Trade\u00a0in Qufu, Shandong province.

Some industries inevitably contract due to foreign competition. And workers in those industries aren\u2019t easily employed in the new jobs that are created.But there\u2019s something else that costs jobs, too: Trade wars.As tensions continue to escalate, poorer households, already struggling to keep up, will face additional downward pressure on their incomes. That\u2019s bad news for the workers whom Trump promised to help.Jeffrey Kucik is assistant professor of political science at the University of Arizona.

The ship has increased its offering of television programs to help passengers pass the time, she said.Pence, recently appointed by Trump to run the White House's response to the coronavirus outbreak, told reporters in a briefing on Friday that all crew would likely remain quarantined aboard the vessel, whether or not they test positive.It was unclear what was in store for passengers who showed no signs or symptoms of illness.The predicament of the Grand Princess was reminiscent of the Diamond Princess cruise liner, also owned by Carnival Corp, the world's leading cruise operator. It was quarantined off Japan in February and was for a time the largest concentration of coronavirus cases outside China.The respiratory illness has spread to more than 90 countries, killing more than 3,400 people and infecting more than 100,000 worldwide.Washington's King County has been the hardest hit area in the United States with at least a dozen of the nation's 17 coronavirus deaths, several of whom were people living at a nursing facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland.\u00a0Thirty health workers from the US\u00a0Public Health Service were due to arrive at the beleaguered LifeCare nursing home on Saturday.

He issued a declaration of emergency.\"It allows expedited purchasing and expedited hiring, which is what we need right now,\" Cuomo told a news conference.The outbreak has begun to have substantial impacts on public life, with festivals and gatherings being cancelled across the country.The economic damage has also intensified and stock markets have continued to tumble. To mitigate against the virus spreading, some banks in New York are dividing their teams of traders between central locations and secondary sites in New Jersey and Connecticut, according to sources familiar with the matter.Goldman Sachs Group Inc had a scare this past week when an employee at its Lower Manhattan offices told the bank he had been at a temple service in a city suburb with a lawyer who later tested positive for the coronavirus. The bank said the employee was sent home and has been under self-quarantine since then \"out of an abundance of caution.\"The employee, however, did not have contact with the lawyer at the service and has not shown any signs of illness, the bank said. He is expected to return to work next week when it would have been two weeks since he attended the service.Goldman also cleaned the floor on which he worked at its headquarters. All floors remained operational, though Goldman let employees who felt uncomfortable work remotely, it said.\"We have no confirmed cases of employees who have contracted COVID-19 and all our buildings are fully operational,\" the bank said.BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of novel coronavirus\u00a0and its developmentsDownload\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegram"},

Its safety record has since improved.Yet Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Oman and the United Kingdom, along with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and more have imposed temporary bans on 737 MAX 8 flying within their countries.\u00a0Airlines that have imposed bans on flying the 737 MAX 8 in their fleet include Gol Airways, Cayman Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, Jet Airways, Aeromexico, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Turkish Airlines, Eastar Jet, Smartwings and LOT.READ:\u00a0What\u2019s behind China\u2019s swift action to ground Boeing 737 MAX flights?

The high regard fellow regulators in Asia have for CAAS makes it possible that other regulators in Asia will also impose a broad suspension on 737 MAX variants.\u00a0Disruption to passenger itineraries is likely in the coming days, especially as airlines attempt to re-deploy their fleets to replace the suspended aircraft and it is unknown how quickly each regulator will lift its suspension.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nFile photo of Changi Airport.\n                            \n\n                    \n                TRAVEL INSURANCE WHEN FLYING ON A 737 MAX 8It is good practice for passengers to purchase travel insurance before travelling regardless of safety risk. Flight accidents are typically covered under accidental death and disablement clauses, and insurers typically base the premium and exclusion on the destination rather than the airline and aircraft model.As with any insurance product, prudence dictates inquiring with the insurer about the details prior to purchase or travel.Also unknown to many fliers is that the Montreal Convention obliges airlines to pay a fixed amount of damages for passenger deaths or injuries that occur on international flights \u2013 but this has yet to be ratified by many countries.\u00a0Many\u00a0travel destinations\u00a0have yet to ratify this treaty, which may allow their airlines to dodge legal liability for accidents, leaving families\u00a0and loved ones of accident victims without any compensation.Still, subject to an airline\u2019s financial situation in the aftermath of a crash, compensation is often paid without admission of liability so as to settle with the victims or their families, and preserve the airline\u2019s reputation.Passengers should check if the airline chosen belongs to a country that has ratified the Convention, or otherwise ensure that the airline or country has policies in place to compensate families\u00a0and loved ones of passengers in the event of an accident.AIRLINE AND AIRCRAFT CHOICE IS ALSO A PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITYGiven the availability of tools to check on the model of aircraft and the variety of airlines and routes available to choose from for travel between any two given destinations, passengers must also be responsible for their travel decisions.Not all countries and airlines have grounded the 737 MAX 8 or other 737 MAX variants, but passengers can manage their safety concerns by assessing risk based on available information combined with the ongoing regulatory and airline announcements.Airlines announce flight schedules and aircraft arrangements long in advance, and many airline and travel websites provide aircraft model information for specific flights especially on those websites that offer the option to select seats (especially as airlines increasingly charge seat selection fees).\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA Boeing 737 MAX 8 airliner lifts off for its first flight on Jan\u00a029, 2016 in Renton, Washington.

The bill breezed through the Senate with a passing vote of 96-1 on Thursday.More than US$3 billion of the approved funds will be devoted to research and development of coronavirus vaccines, test kits and treatments. There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for the illness that began in China and has infected more than 95,000 people in about 80 countries and territories.READ: Facebook, Google ask San Francisco staff to work from home as coronavirus spreadsAn\u00a0Air National Guard helicopter\u00a0flew testing kits to the cruise liner\u00a0after at least 35 people developed flu-like symptoms aboard the ship. Medical staff took samples from 46 passengers and crew to determine if they have contracted the respiratory virus.The samples were carried back to a state laboratory in the Bay area. Pence said 21 of the tests came back positive, 24 were negative and one was inconclusive.In the meantime, passengers aboard the ship said they had been largely confined to their staterooms since Thursday afternoon, as the cruise line requested. One passenger who spoke on Thursday with Reuters, Kathy Reid, 67, a retiree from Granbury, Texas, said she and others felt like they were in \"limbo\".California Governor Gavin Newsom has insisted that the ship, which had been due to return from Hawaii to its home port in San Francisco on Wednesday, remain at sea until everyone aboard who is sick or at risk of exposure to coronavirus can be tested.Health officials had said on Thursday they planned to initially test 35 passengers and crew who have reported symptoms consistent with coronavirus, as well as dozens of \"holdover\" passengers from an earlier voyage to Mexico.State and local officials acted to halt the cruise liner after learning people aboard had fallen ill and two passengers who traveled on the same vessel last month to Mexico later tested positive for coronavirus.One, an elderly man from Placer County near Sacramento with underlying health conditions, died this week, marking the first documented coronavirus fatality in California. The other, from the Bay area, was described by Newsom as gravely sick.Health officials say both individuals likely contracted the virus aboard the ship.A third passenger from the Mexico trip, a Canadian woman from the province of Alberta, has since been reported by health officials there to have tested positive.Health officials were also seeking to contact some 2,500 passengers who disembarked in San Francisco on Feb. 21 after the earlier cruise to Mexico.EIGHT STATES REPORT FIRST CASESOn Friday, eight states - Pennsylvania, Indiana, Minnesota, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Nebraska, South Carolina and Hawaii - reported their first cases, meaning more than half of the 50 U.S. states now have the virus.Word of the new cases capped a week during which the virus began to disrupt daily life for many Americans.In Seattle, the epicenter of the nation's outbreak, there were school closures and orders to work from home. In areas less affected by the outbreak, music festivals, conferences and sports events were canceled or curtailed as a precaution.In the most high profile cancellation, the South by Southwest (SXSW) music and technology festival in Austin, Texas, was called off on Friday.The respiratory illness emerged in China and has spread to more than 90 nations, killing more than 3,400 people and infecting more than 100,000 worldwide.As stocks plunge and U.S. companies grapple with the economic fallout, the Trump administration is weighing tax relief for the deeply affected cruise, travel and airline industries, according to a source familiar with the plan.AMERICANS DIVIDED ON DANGERSAmericans are sharply divided over the dangers of the new coronavirus, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.Critics of Trump, including Democratic lawmakers, have accused the president of downplaying the significance of the outbreak for political reasons. He has said the risk to Americans is low.Washington's King County has been the hardest hit area in the United States with at least a dozen of the nation's 15 coronavirus deaths, several of whom were people living at a nursing facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland.Officials said a team of 30 medical professionals from the US Public Health Service will deploy on Saturday to help the beleaguered LifeCare nursing home. \"We are grateful that the cavalry is arriving,\" King County Executive Dow Constanine told reporters on Friday.In Florida, officials on Friday announced two deaths and canceled two Miami music festivals - Ultra and Calle Ocho - because of potential risk that coronavirus could spread at events with large crowds.For similar reasons, the NCAA Division III men's basketball tournament will go ahead at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore this weekend but without spectators, the university said on Friday.The University of Washington announced on Friday that all classes would be held virtually for the rest of the winter term to limit contagion.Apple Inc on Friday asked staff at its Silicon Valley headquarters to work from home if possible as a \"precaution.\" Gap Inc closed its New York headquarters because one employee had tested positive.In Maryland, the focus was on a patient with coronavirus who attended a public event last Saturday at a retirement community in the Washington suburb of Rockville and came into contact with as many as 100 people, Governor Larry Hogan said.The crisis has hit stocks hard. The benchmark S&P 500 closed down another 1.7 per cent\u00a0on Friday, after falling nearly 3 per cent the day before.As new states report their first cases, others watched their tally grow. Cases in New York jumped to 44 from 22, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday, adding that some 4,000 people in the state were under precautionary quarantine and 44 under mandatory quarantine.But he also tried to stem any sense of panic.\"I think the anxiety and the fear is more of a problem than the virus,\" Cuomo said.Amid widespread criticism of not enough tests available for states in need, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged that \"some missteps\" had initially slowed the distribution of tests, but said the overall response was going well.\"In the next couple of weeks we should be ratcheted up to get many more out,\" Fauci said on NBC's Today program.BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of novel coronavirus\u00a0and its developmentsDownload\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegram"},

Mueller\u2019s team will present more than 1,000 pieces of evidence \u2013 nearly three times what it submitted in the trial that just ended.\u00a0They will tell the sordid story of Manafort\u2019s work in the United States as an agent of a foreign interest \u2013 Ukraine\u2019s ousted Yanukovych.\u00a0 They will reveal Manafort\u2019s connections to the man charged with him, Konstantin Kilimnik \u2013 a Russian national tied to the GRU, Russia\u2019s main intelligence directive, who also served as liaison between Manafort and Russian oligarchs.That Manafort was simultaneously the campaign manager of the highly improbable Putin-admiring nominee of the Republican Party might \u2013 or might not \u2013 consign presidential tweets about \u201cwitch hunts\u201d to the digital dustbin once and for all.But it might change Washington by at last nudging Congress to pass legislation cracking down on Russian election interference.

It may expose Trump\u2019s tweets and lawyer Rudy Giuliani\u2019s rhetoric as the weapons of mass distraction that they are: The desperate posturing of those who want to change the subject.Whether it gets Congress off the sidelines or separates Trump from a complicit party is another question. But outside Washington, Americans invariably believe no one is above the law, not even the president.IN MOSCOW AND KIEV, MIXED RESULTSIn Moscow, Putin will surely know his long-sought opportunity for post-Helsinki summitry has evaporated. Although Trump insists that Manafort\u2019s \u201cvery sad\u201d conviction \u201chas nothing to with Russian collusion,\u201d his advisers must realise that Trump can\u2019t afford to be seen within a country mile of this former KGB agent.Putin should know that pressure will only intensify for a confrontation as long as he attacks Western democracies with abandon.In Kiev, the fallout is more complicated: Manafort\u2019s downfall builds pressure to punish Yanukovych hold-overs \u2013 those that haven\u2019t fled to Moscow \u2013 for their role in the same rot that consumed the once-fabled Republican operative.But Kiev may, paradoxically, feel the need to stay in Trump\u2019s good graces, which may curb Ukraine\u2019s willingness to risk alienating the US president.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nAt his July summit with the Russian leader in Helsinki, Donald Trump appeared to be rather conciliatory towards Vladimir Putin, shortly after raising hackles at a NATO summit in Brussels with his contrarian stance.

Why would Beijing, with its patient, command and control system, its \u201cresistance economy,\u201d ever rush to resolve a trade war begun by a US president it may now see as permanently weakened?Pyongyang\u2019s calculation may be the opposite. Surely Kim Jong Un perceives that Trump, always too eager to declare a \u201cdeal\u201d without pausing over the fine print, may now be even more desperate for a \u201cwin\u201d on the world stage.The bottom line? Expect the United States and the world to be roiled by the fallout of the Manafort conviction and whatever comes out of his trial.Trump will tweet, Mueller will continue to seek the facts, and America for now will suffer a reality television drama playing out on an all too real global stage.David Eckels Wade is a fellow with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\u00a0"},

When thwarted, China has shown it can think up its own.At the same time, the Trump administration seems to be doing its level best to run a competition calculated from the starting gate to lose the race, or the war, whichever it turns out to be. The US president\u2019s latest effort was to threaten a rise in tariffs on US$200 billion worth of Chinese goods \u2013 from 10 per cent to 25 per cent.Within 24 hours, China quickly reciprocated with a list of 5,207 American products, worth US$60 billion, on which it pledged to exact new tariffs ranging from 5 to 25 per cent if Trump implements his threats.And there we\u00a0have - a full-blown trade war.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementREAD: The US no longer leader of the free world, a commentaryLITTLE UNDERSTANDING OF CHINAFortunately, Trump has extended a comment period before implementation until September. Meanwhile, markets on both sides of the Pacific continue unsettled \u2013 at times balancing on the edge of panic.While the Chinese stock market has taken more of a beating than the American, Trump seems to think that the United States can stand the pain longer than China and tightening the screws will bring Beijing to the negotiating table.\n    Advertisement\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nEmployees work at DingTalk office in Hangzhou.\u00a0(Photo: Reuters/Aly Song)\n                            \n\n                    \n                But that reflects little understanding of either the Chinese mindset or the underlying strength of the Chinese economy which, though weaker than a year ago, is still growing nearly twice as fast as the American.And this by no means reflects how bad it could get as individuals with little understanding of either the stakes or the mechanisms plunge into this pending maelstrom.READ:\u00a0Fork in the road as brewing trade war hints at revision of US-China relations, a commentaryHARDLY COMPETITIONLast week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo unveiled with some fanfare another way of dealing with, even isolating China that approaches the ridiculous in its scale and futility. Dubbed the \u201cIndo Pacific Economic Vision Programme\u201d it was widely viewed as a counter to China\u2019s long-standing Belt and Road development initiative that has ensnared nations across Asia and onward to Europe.But it is a decidedly skinflint counter. Trump has committed a derisory US$113 million to his programme \u2013 a rounding error compared with the US$900 billion estimated for Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road, which China bankrolled at US$82 billion three years ago.This hardly even seems to be a competition. Yet as the South China Morning Post put it, the US initiative is \u201clikely to fuel suspicions from Beijing \u2026 and could in turn worsen relations that are already fraught with trade tensions\u201d.Moreover, China seems prepared to do all it can to keep control of its global trading strategy, offering Britain talks leading to a post-Brexit free trade deal on Monday, while continuing to hold the United States at bay.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks during a news conference at the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Singapore August 4, 2018.

So Alibaba created a different, in many respects more innovative, product using blockchain-based technology.\u201cAny new business, while growing up, always encounters obstacles. We understand that. It is part of the cost of doing business,\u201d Ming said, adding:So we might be frustrated. But because the value we create is so overwhelming, we will find some way to overcome that barrier.\u00a0That doesn\u2019t mean that many Chinese companies and state-run enterprises in China aren\u2019t still poised to appropriate innovations from Silicon Valley. But the more America tries to block them, the more likely the Chinese are to come up with their own solutions.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nAnt Financial, which is controlled by Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, provides mobile payment, lending, and credit services to millions of Chinese consumers.

But, as Ming suggests:It\u2019s not about our size, it\u2019s about our innovation experience and our understanding of where the future goes.It is this profound understanding and acceptance of the long game that may ultimately leave China the winner in any trade war.READ:\u00a0We may be in the early stages of a new Cold War, a commentaryThe Chinese, and especially its leadership, have quite a strong and evolved sense of self. Their ability to withstand external forces dates back not just to Mao Zedong and the communist revolution that brought them to power after World War II.It\u2019s more useful to look back to the Zhou dynasty from thousands of years before, which based the legitimacy of its emperor on whether he was sufficiently virtuous to rule \u2013 and receive the mandate from heaven to do so. A people with such an evolved sense of destiny and self-worth is unlikely to see a secular leader like Donald Trump as a major obstacle.\u00a0In China, losing face is the ultimate failure. While the best, and most lasting, trade agreements must be at least perceived as a win-win, Trump now seems to have dug himself so deeply into his America First corner that it allows little room for the Chinese leadership to manoeuvre without losing that face.Trump must brace for a long and bruising conflict.

During Donald Trump\u2019s campaign for the US presidency, concern was expressed about his views on trade. In 2016, USA Today ran the story \u201cTrump\u2019s trade policies worry economists\u201d.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementYet despite a strident protectionist line both throughout his campaign and when he came into office, there seemed to be a view that Trump\u2019s bark would be worse than his bite.TRADE THREATS DOWNPLAYEDEven after Trump ordered steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, of 25 per cent and 10 per cent respectively, earlier this year, there was a view that it would be alarmist to talk about a trade war. Prominent economist Dani Rodick said in March that the reality is that Trump\u2019s trade measures to date amount to small potatoes.This tendency to play down the seriousness of a Trump-inspired trade war seemed to reflect a view that it is only a concern if the restrictive measures he has announced are likely to result in a full-blown crisis.\n    Advertisement\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThroughout his campaign as President-elect,\u00a0US President Donald Trump made a string of controversial remarks implying that trade and defense agreements with Asian allies were lopsided and disadvantageous for America (Photo: AFP/Mandel Ngan)\n\n                            \n\n                    \n                For example, in March, two observers implied that we should not be too concerned because Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminium wouldn\u2019t spell a recession for the world or for Australia.What was not taken into account sufficiently is how a trade war can escalate with tit-for-tat restrictive measures. And a recession should not be the benchmark for escalating concern over Trump\u2019s trade policies.In a world that is only starting to throw off the constraints of the global financial crisis, we should take any policies that are likely to restrain growth very seriously, even if they do not result in a recession.The trade war has escalated. While Trump may have flip-flopped on other issues, he has consistently implemented his threats to address \u201cunfair trade\u201d, at least in his eyes.READ:\u00a0We may be in the early stages of a new Cold War, a commentaryRISING, SERIOUS THREATS On Jul\u00a06, Trump ordered 25 per cent tariffs on approximately US$34 billion of Chinese imports, which were promptly met by retaliatory tariffs on an equivalent volume of US exports to China.On Jul\u00a020, Trump was \u201cready to go\u201d and impose tariffs on US$500 billion of imports from China, and he has threatened sweeping tariffs on automobile imports from the European Union.In the lead-up to the G20 Finance Minister\u2019s Meeting on weekend, the International Monetary Fund issued a Surveillance Note warning that:The likelihood of escalating and sustained trade actions has risen, threatening a serious adverse impact on global growth.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFinance ministers and Central Bank presidents pose for the official photo at the G20 Meeting of Finance Ministers in Buenos Aires, Argentina, July 21, 2018. (Photo: REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci)\n                            \n\n                    \n                READ: Fork in the road for US-China relations as trade war heats up, a commentary.READ: No good time for a trade war but now as good as any other, a commentary.The note contained four hypothetical trade scenarios for the global economy. If all currently announced tariffs go into effect, global output would be reduced by 0.1 per cent by 2020.It does not sound much. But the International Monetary Fund points out that if global confidence is shaken by these tariffs, which is likely, global GDP could decrease by 0.5 per cent \u2013 or around US$430 billion \u2013 below the current projection for 2020.Such an outcome would make a serious dent in global growth.It was only four years ago, under the Australian G20 presidency, that the objective was to increase global growth by an additional 2 per cent over five years, and the measure of success for the G20 was the extent to which additional growth was achieved.The G20 cannot now take any comfort in the extent to which their restrictive trade policies will \u201conly\u201d result in a decline in growth that would otherwise be achieved.TO AVOID TRADE WAR, DO NOTHINGIf the G20 members took the Trump-inspired trade war seriously, what could they do about it?The finance ministers could at a minimum signal to the rest of the world that they discussed it at their recent meeting rather than releasing a communique featuring such bland words as \u201cwe are working to strengthen the contribution of trade to our economies\u201d.What happened to previous commitments to resisting protectionism, even if they did not follow through with them?G20 finance ministers need to get real and signal that a tit-for-tat trade war will seriously damage growth, even if the US will not sign up to such a message.The US needs to be isolated and not accommodated.Moreover, the best thing G20 members could do to avoid a trade war is signal that they will \u201cdo nothing\u201d. That is, they should commit to not engage in retaliation.In March, the Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said that while Trump\u2019s trade policies are not positive for the world economy, they are manageable if countries don\u2019t retaliate.Dani Rodick recently observed that if Europe, China, and other countries want to uphold a rules-based multilateral system, they should not mirror Trump\u2019s unilateralism and take matters into their own hands by retaliating. They should work through the World Trade Organisation.If one member of the G20 issues trade barriers, the rest of the G20 members should condemn the move, but commit to maintaining their open borders and avoiding a trade war.Mike Callaghan is a Nonresident Fellow at the Lowy Institute.

In addition, these resources present a small range of options for addressing the problem.CAUSES OF CLIMATE CHANGE DOWNPLAYED\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementNine resources in our study did reflect the scientific consensus that human activity is a major driver of climate change, but we found that another six \u2013 including several science textbooks \u2013 were hesitant, communicating uncertainty about the conclusions expressed in the 2007 landmark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.READ:\u00a0Avoiding climate chaos means 'unprecedented' change: UN report\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nAt current levels of greenhouse gas emissions, the IPCC report finds with \"high confidence\", we will zoom past the 1.5C marker around 2040 (Photo: AFP/SPENCER PLATT)\n                            \n\n                    \n                For instance, one earth science textbook published in 2010 says that \u201cresearchers are trying to determine if the (temperature) increase is a natural variation or the result of human activities\u201d.\n    AdvertisementSimilarly, one geography textbook published in 2012 states that scientists \u201cdo not all agree on the nature of global warming and its effects.\u201d\u201cSome claim that a natural cycle, not human activity, is causing rising temperatures,\u201d this particular textbook states.\u00a0Others claim that the evidence for global warming is inconclusive.Such messages suggest that humans may not be responsible for climate change \u2013 and that global warming itself could be a myth.\u00a0These ideas were common in some of the curricula we examined.\u00a0Two sets of supplemental materials directly challenge the idea that human activities cause climate change, with one calling this notion \u201cfar from settled\u201d.These curricula helped shape the views of young Americans who are now in their 20s. Perhaps more importantly, there\u2019s a good chance many of these materials are still in use now, given that some school teachers have access only to ageing textbooks.LITTLE IS MENTIONED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGEBeyond the fact that some publishers hedged when it came to the cause of global climate change, we also found that they provided limited content about the impact\u00a0of climate change.\u00a012 of 17 curricular resources made little mention of extreme weather events, such as droughts and hurricanes.Only two of the resources we examined had more than five sentences about the growing challenge of access to fresh drinking water.\u00a0About half ignored the issue altogether.\u00a0When materials did explore the impacts of climate change, they often portrayed these problems as quite distant \u2013 for example, affecting Alaska and northern Canada but not the mainland US.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nHurricane Michael made landfall in Mexico Beach, Florida, on Oct\u00a010 as a catastrophic Category 4 storm.

This is significant because the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other leading scientific organisations agree that addressing global warming and its impacts will also require adaptation \u2013 and perhaps geo-engineering.Since adaptation strategies, such as modifying land use and developing drought-resistant crops, will be helpful for coping with the impacts described above, we believe school materials should explore these ideas.READ:\u00a0Typhoon Mangkhut destroys rice, corn and fish \u2013 but what has this got to do with Singapore? A commentaryHowever, many materials focused only on individual responses \u2013 such as turning off lights and driving less \u2013 instead of collective or policy responses.\u00a0Social studies materials more frequently highlighted the need for government action, but we are concerned about how much exposure students get to policy solutions when they are in science class.As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other leading scientists have made clear, society needs to take substantial action to prevent the worst consequences of climate change.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA scene from the 'Rise For Climate' event in San Francisco, which took place as as a monster hurricane bore down on the US eastern seaboard (Photo: AFP/Amy Osborne)\n                            \n\n                    \n                READ: Climate change needs better storytelling to address severe threats, a commentaryIt\u2019s true that some states in the US are working to improve climate change education and to convey the seriousness of the issue to young people.\u00a0For instance, as part of a major climate science initiative in Washington state, approximately US$1 million is being awarded through competitive grants to nonprofit community-based organisations to work with school districts \u201cto build student understanding and problem solving around local environmental challenges\".Researchers at Indiana University are training teachers in the \u201cscience of climate change and its predicted impact on the state\".It will take these kinds of efforts and more to prepare young people for future challenges.\u00a0There\u2019s still time, but schools should make sure that curricular materials communicate what scientists have been saying for well over a decade now \u2013 that is, humans are responsible for climate change, the impacts will be serious, and we need to respond wisely.Brett Levy is assistant professor of educational theory and practice at the University at Albany, State University of New York.\u00a0Lauren Collet-Gildard is a graduate Student, and Social Studies Educator at the same university.

Trials were cancelled, some supermarket shelves were empty, and even the city's imposing Gothic cathedral closed its doors, disappointing tourists.\"We were only meant to spend three days in Milan and then go to Venice for the carnival but everything is shut,\" said Russian tourist Violla Belova, 50, wearing a face mask as she took photographs of the shuttered Duomo cathedral.\"I hope we won't have to cut our trip short,\" she said.With other countries looking to prevent the spread of coronavirus, Mauritius on Monday told passengers from Lombardy and Veneto aboard an Alitalia aircraft that they would either have to go into quarantine or else fly straight back home.Alitalia said 40 out of the 224 passengers and crew were affected by the ban and decided to leave the Indian Ocean island immediately.Ireland said its citizens should not travel to parts of Italy affected by the outbreak. Tunisia announced on Monday that it may suspend some flights to Italy to reduce its exposure to the coronavirus.Austria briefly blocked a train from Italy at its border on Sunday because of concerns over the health of two travellers.Italy's tourism industry, which accounts for up to 13% of the gross domestic product, sounded the alarm bell.\"We have been swamped by cancellations in the last few days, in restaurants, hotels, everywhere,\" said Patrizio Bertin, the head of the Veneto branch of Italy's trade lobby Confcommercio.Marco Michielli, head of Veneto's hoteliers' association Federalberghi, said cancellations were \"raining down all over the region, like in the rest of Italy,\" and criticised the draconian measures adopted by the authorities.\"I think the government has been excessively prudent, to use a euphemism, it's as though there were an Ebola epidemic.\"Lombardy shares a border with France, while the other regions also neighbour Switzerland and Austria.France has said there is no need to close borders in response to the spread of virus in Italy.BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of novel coronavirus\u00a0and its developmentsDownload our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegram"},

The United Nations World Tourism\u00a0Organisation listed in the top 10 busiest airports in 2018, the Beijing Capital International Airport\u00a0and Shanghai Pudong International Airport - ranked number 2 and number 9 respectively.It was barely a few years ago\u00a0when it was a running joke in China that if your flight had taken off two hours later than its scheduled departure time, it was\u00a0considered to be on time.Yet, Chinese air traffic controllers have made tremendous progress in improving\u00a0air traffic flows and increasing\u00a0the frequency of safe take-offs and landings.Chinese carriers which had to suspend 737 MAX service - namely Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Hainan Airlines \u2013 have a busy schedule and often\u00a0fly at full capacity.Twenty-nine international and domestic flights were canceled on Monday alone and hundreds more will be canceled in\u00a0the week ahead, even as carriers make arrangements to swap planes to avoid service disruption.That could mean millions in lost revenue\u00a0for Chinese carriers as they must refund tickets or re-schedule passengers.COMAC TO FILL GAPSThe context also is that China has been building up its aviation industry in recent years and is on the cusp of more aggressively pushing its C919 aircraft to airline companies worldwide.The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the designer, developer and manufacturer of China\u2019s narrow-body twin-jet C919 passenger aircraft, has begun construction of its customer service training hub in Jiaxing, Zhejiang province.The centre is expected to train flight attendants, aircraft maintenance and dispatch service staff\u00a0so that they will be prepared when the C919 and wide-body C929 passenger airplanes start flying commercially.\u00a0The roll-out of the C919 has\u00a0been slow since its launch in May 2017 after a successful but lengthy testing phase, but the opening of the training centre is set to give it a boost.The 40,500 sq m training base will be operational\u00a0by September 2020. COMAC has also just signed a joint project agreement between China and Russia to develop the C929 plane.Still, COMAC has met with roadblocks in its expansion plans, not least because the US FAA has refused to grant certification and approvals for flights or flight tests in US territory.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nIn this file photo taken on Mar\u00a07, 2017 the Boeing logo Boeing 737 MAX 9 airplane is pictured during its rollout for media at the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington.

Software has proved its value since the 1988 launch of the A320, the first \u201cfourth-generation\u201d fly-by-wire aircraft.TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE FLYING SAFERIt is a familiar fact, but worth repeating, that flying is far less dangerous than it was decades ago \u2014 the 11 fatal accidents per million flights in 1960 fell to around 0.1 in 2017, with only six fatal crashes and 19 deaths.The number of accidental deaths increased last year to 523, partly due to the Lion Air crash, but safety keeps on advancing.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe cockpit of Boeing's new 737 MAX-9 is pictured under construction at their production facility in Renton, Washington, U.S., on Feb\u00a013, 2017.

Nearly half the commercial aircraft in service are now fourth-generation jets, which have reduced \u201closs of control in flight\u201d crashes such as the Lion Air case by 75 per cent, according to Airbus.DANGERS ON THE BORDER BETWEEN HUMAN AND COMPUTER CONTROLTechnology has its drawbacks \u2014 the spread of fly-by-wire and use of autopilot means that some of the biggest dangers lie on the border between human and computer control. Pilots usually switch on autopilot shortly after take-off and do not fly manually until landing (the FAA estimates that autopilot is used for 90 per cent of flying time), which limits their experience.The best known recent case of pilots being unable to cope without technology was the Air France flight 447 crash of an Airbus 330 over the Atlantic in 2009.Its autopilot disengaged in a storm because airspeed sensors were blocked and an inexperienced co-pilot put it into too steep a climb. While the control system warned loudly of the danger, it stalled and fell out of the sky.The 737 MAX\u00a08 may have suffered the opposite problem \u2014 the pilots were flying both jets manually but part of the flight software is designed to override the aircraft\u2019s tendency to pitch its nose up when climbing and turning.\u00a0In the Lion Air case, a faulty sensor reading could have made the computers respond as if it was breaching its flight envelope, although it was not.READ:\u00a0After Lion Air crash, some ask if Boeing\u2019s 737 jets are safe to fly, a commentaryFLY MANUALLYThe 737 MAX\u00a08 crashes will turn out to have been avoidable if the fly-by-wire software contributed to losses of control. But Boeing need not redesign its aircraft entirely, and curbing the involvement of computers in flight systems more generally makes little sense.The moral is that pilots should be sufficiently trained and practised to fly manually if required.Given the choice of flying on an aircraft with pilots who are wholly in charge of the trip, or one on which software is able to countermand them if it senses an error, I would pick the latter.The 737 MAX\u00a08 accidents, tragic though they are, do not alter that."},

ZTE\u2019s violation of US sanctions resulted in massive monetary penalties, a temporary revocation of its US operating licenses and the denial of access to US technology.There was extensive collateral damage to ZTE\u2019s extended business ecosystems. Qualcomm, Google, Acacia Communications and host of small first and second tier suppliers were adversely impacted by ZTE\u2019s US technology ban.The US Commerce Department is currently looking into expanding the list of \u201cstrategic trade\u201d items.\u201cStrategically sensitive\u201d parts, components and technology require businesses to methodically screen buyers and down-stream end-users, as well as trace the movement of thousands of parts, components and widgets throughout value chains.

Ant Financial, of the Alibaba e-commerce group, was recently blocked from buying MoneyGram, the American remittances company, on the grounds that the private data of millions of US citizens would be compromised in the hands of a Chinese company.This rationale will lead the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS) to block an increasing number of acquisitions, mergers and license agreements between Chinese and US firms.\u00a0CFIUS recently blocked Chinese telecom behemoth Huawei from selling equipment to AT&T the US telephone company.Beyond simple privacy concerns, the National Security Agency, the FBI and other US intelligence agencies have proclaimed that high-tech equipment made by Chinese firms would pose a cyber security and espionage risks to the US government and American consumers.This puts Beijing\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan, which is funnelling hundreds of billions in subsidies to high tech firms, directly in Washington\u2019s firing line. Vulnerable sectors include robotics, AI, autonomous vehicles, aerospace and 5G networks technology.TREND TOWARDS LOCALISED PRODUCTIONEven as increased tariffs are causing companies to think about moving manufacturing and sourcing operations to new locations, the need to manage non-tariff measures regarding technology controls will leapfrog tariff planning.Regulatory delays, licensing mishaps and mismanagement of buyer-seller relationships, all from an export controls perspective, are more damaging to global businesses than tariffs.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nIn a trade war with the US, China has other weapons beside tariffs to cause damage including hitting Boeing which sells a quarter of its planes in China AFP/Daniel SLIM\n                            \n\n                    \n                By shortening supply chains and moving production activities within key markets \u2014 many of which are in the growing megacities of Asia \u2014 companies are seeking to achieve greater proximity, access and coordination with localised contractors, sub-contractors and strategic partners. This makes regulatory risk management easier and lowers operational costs.Industry 4.0 and digital innovation is already driving the trend towards localisation. Global firms are responding to demand-driven, highly customised local markets by leveraging new digital technology.3D printing, e-commerce platforms and new collaborative networks are leading to new business models that favour more agile local supply chains. These new value networks are increasingly replacing traditional offshore\u00a0global supply chains.Other non-tariff barriers around technology controls will accelerate the trend towards localised production. In Asia, an increase in data localisation laws are forcing global firms to deal with the fragmentation of data flows and supply chains\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, China, the Philippines and Thailand all have some form of data localisation laws that are in place or are under consideration. \u00a0\u00a0NEW TECH CLUSTERSAn increase in both American and Chinese tech regulations \u2014 such as Beijing\u2019s recent blockage of chip sales by Micron, the American firm \u2014 will lead to the emergence of specialised technology clusters around the world.These clusters will be essential for attracting all the right elements needed in a productive and innovative technology ecosystem, as well as keeping out the wrong, non-compliant elements.The Singapore Smart-City\u00a0model provides a compelling example.\u00a0The city-state\u2019s policymakers have succeeded in establishing benchmarks in all the key areas: World-class infrastructure and logistics, strong rule of law that seeks to emphasise transparency and good-governance standards, an emphasis on human capital development and skills, open markets and participation multilateral free trade agreements.These attributes will result in fully ring-fenced business ecosystems, where only firms that have been vetted for, for example, US technology licensing and controls, will participate.Excluded entities, many of which could be Chinese firms, will seek to form their own clusters, most likely in China. Other firms wishing to escape the long shadow of American sanctions and technology controls may choose to migrate their activities to a Chinese dominated technology cluster.The effects of a US-China geopolitical rivalry will be far-reaching. Tariffs will disrupt and re-organise global value chains, but companies need to prepare for the much more pervasive effects of a Sino-US tech war.Alex Capri is Visiting Senior Fellow with the Department of Analytics & Operations at NUS Business School.

Addis Ababa as well as \"newly refined satellite data.\"\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementEarlier on Wednesday, Canada also joined the long list of countries to ban the plane from flying in its airspace and many airlines have voluntarily taken it out of service.READ:\u00a0US pilots reported problems with Boeing 737 MAXThe FAA said it will continue to work with investigators to determine the cause of the crash, while Ethiopia said it would send the black boxes to Europe for analysis.\"Hopefully they will come up with an answer but until they do the planes are grounded,\" Trump said of the planes.\n    AdvertisementBoeing chief Dennis Muilenburg said he supported the US decision \"out of an abundance of caution,\" but continues to have \"full confidence\" in the safety of the plane.The company continues its efforts \"to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators, deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again,\" Muilenburg said in a statement.Preliminary accounts of the Ethiopian Airlines flight appear similar to the Lion Air crash in October, which were echoed in concerns registered by US pilots on how the MAX 8

Air crash, all complaining the aircraft suddenly pitched downward shortly after takeoff, according to documents reviewed by AFP on the Aviation Safety Reporting System, a voluntary incident database maintained by NASA.In two anonymous reports on flights just after the Lion Air crash, pilots disconnected the autopilot and corrected the plane's trajectory.One said the flight crew reviewed the incident \"at length ... but can't think of any reason the aircraft would pitch nose-down so aggressively\".It was unclear if US transportation authorities review the database or investigate the incidents, however the FAA said this week it had mandated Boeing update its flight software and training on the aircraft.Questions on the Lion Air crash have honed in on an automated stall prevention system, the MCAS, designed to automatically point the nose of the plane downward if it is in danger of stalling.According to the flight data recorder, the pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 struggled to control the aircraft as the automated MCAS system repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down following takeoff.The Ethiopian Airlines pilots reported similar difficulties before their aircraft plunged into the ground.READ:\u00a0The nations, airlines grounding Boeing 737 MAX aircraftBoeing came in for criticism after the Lion Air crash for allegedly failing to adequately inform 737 pilots about the functioning of the anti-stalling system.Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde GebreMariam on Sunday said the captain on the flight, Yared Mulugeta Getachew, 29, was an experienced aviator with more than 8,000 flight hours.Speaking to CNN on Wednesday, Tewolde said there were \"significant similarities\" between the Lion Air and ET 302 crashes.\"There are a lot of questions to be answered on the

decide by Thursday which country would examine the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder recovered from the ill-fated Flight ET 302, spokesman Asrat Begashaw told AFP.\"We are going to send it to Europe but the country is not specified yet,\" Asrat said.The airline said Ethiopia does not have the equipment to read the black box data that could provide crucial information about what happened.The Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX 8 was less than four months old when it went down six minutes into a flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi on Sunday, disintegrating on impact.Asrat said families of the victims from Kenya, China, America, and Canada, as well as diplomatic staff from embassies, were visiting the crash site.Canada Transport Minister Marc Garneau said Ottawa made the decision to close the country's airspace to the plane given the similarities between the Ethiopian crash and the Lion Air accident.A dozen airlines have grounded the plane, while Nigeria, Lebanon, Egypt, Serbia, Vietnam and\u00a0New Zealand\u00a0on Wednesday became the latest countries to ban it from their airspace.The European Union and major hubs such as the United Arab Emirates and Australia had already done so.American Airlines said it was informed of the FAA decision earlier in the day and had 24 aircraft affected by the US ban, while Southwest Airlines said it was still confirming the move.Low-cost airline Norwegian Air Shuttle has said it will demand financial compensation from Boeing as the implications of the mass grounding for the airline industry remained unclear.The MAX series, which is Boeing's fastest-selling model, with more than 5,000 orders placed to date from about 100 customers. There are about 350 MAX 8s in service around the world.Thomas Anthony, head of the Aviation Safety and Security Programme at the University of Southern California, said increasing automation of planes means crews have less experience flying manually.\"So it's not just a mechanical, it is not just a software problem, but it is a problem of communication and trust,\" he said."},

The Chinese reaction to US sanctions imposed on Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE was telling.\u00a0Tariff hikes are hugely significant for individual companies and may potentially permanently alter supply chains that matter to American farmers and companies, but tariffs are tactical, all too easily employed and, once the havoc is wrought, relatively easy to withdraw.\u00a0Both sides could declare victory and move on, albeit having destroyed a great deal of wealth along the way and perhaps permanently damaging some iconic American and Chinese firms.But investment and trade restrictions in the high technology area are strategic.\u00a0It is already the case that the majority of Chinese citizens believe America is determined to contain China\u2019s \u201cpeaceful rise\".Prospective US high technology-related restrictions add some substance to those charges, pointing toward truly adversarial relations, from Beijing\u2019s perspective.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nThe logo of China's ZTE Corp is seen on the building of ZTE Beijing research and development center in Beijing, China on Jun\u00a013, 2018.

To answer this question, one has to query, what does China want?From 1992 to 2012, the answer for China was that it wanted integration into the global economy, stability on its borders to allow for steady and predictable growth in the domestic economy, and a sustained opportunity to reap benefits from the rules-based institutions overseeing the global economic order.\u00a0In short, it wanted to industrialise and lift its citizens out of poverty just as the major industrialised countries of the global economy had done in their own times of economic transformation.\u00a0The US wanted to incentivise a China that would play by global rules, disrupt minimally as it brought hundreds of millions of people into the global economy, and gradually take decisions that were more convergent with than divergent from North American and European strategic directions.\u00a0Gradually since 2007 to 2008, and more rapidly and explicitly since 2012, that proposition has changed. Under President Xi Jinping, China wants its own world vision to be reflected in global institutions that help determine policy development in the industrialised world.\u00a0In short, China\u00a0and the North American and European mainstream are diverging from each other.\u00a0If the 2015 Paris Climate Change agreement featuring co-leads Obama and Xi was the epitome of US-China cooperative global leadership, the Chinese-hosted World Internet Conference that promotes a fractured global internet governed by sovereign authorities in sovereign space is a good example of US-China divergence on a core element of the 21st century economy.Where we go from here depends on that willingness of both sides to compromise for the longer-term benefit of their citizens.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nA sign of Alibaba Group is seen during the fourth World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China on\u00a0Dec\u00a03, 2017.

Is the point of a trade war between China and the US to prevent China from developing the advanced technologies that will power the global economy in the decades to come?Or is it to create more reciprocal trade and investment relations so American firms can operate as freely in China as Chinese firms operate in the US?\u00a0Or is it to reduce the US merchandise trade deficit with China over the next year or two?\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS and Chinese officials meet to discuss trade and industrial practices.

Will we continue to find sufficient common ground to support a policy of engagement that balances competition and cooperation?Or are we headed in divergent directions that require an adversarial relationship where competition is the default and cooperation is the exception?\u00a0Chinese and American citizens are not the only ones with a stake in the answer.\u00a0The alternative to the global system that China wants to replace is unbounded power politics.\u00a0If China, North America, and Europe cannot come together in their respective visions of the world order, what would a 21st century Hobbesian struggle look like?It seems self-evident that America is better off in an interconnected world bound together by security partnerships and trade treaties; so is China, and so is the global economy.\u00a0James R Keith is managing director at McLarty Associates.

Ellis declared a mistrial on 10 counts on which the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict.But the jurors found Manafort guilty of the remaining eight counts: five of making false income tax returns, two of bank fraud and one of failure to report foreign bank and financial accounts.While the 69-year-old Manafort could theoretically live out the remainder of his years in prison as a result of the convictions, a legal expert told AFP that his time behind bars would in reality likely last under a decade.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementJust before leaving the courtroom, Manafort winked to his wife, who was present for the verdict.Manafort's lawyer Kevin Downing said his client was \"evaluating all of his options\" and thanked the judge for a \"fair trial.\"\"Mr Manafort is disappointed of not getting acquittals all the way through, or a complete hung jury on all counts,\" Downing told journalists.'GOOD MAN'\n    AdvertisementReacting to the verdict as he arrived in West Virginia for a rally of supporters, Trump described Manafort as a \"good man,\" said he was \"very sad\" at the trial outcome -\u00a0and once more denounced the Mueller investigation as a \"witch hunt.\"Trump had previously suggested that Manafort, who briefly served as his campaign manager, was being treated worse than late American gangster Al Capone.He has refused to rule out a pardon. Observers have speculated that the prospect of a pardon may have explained why Manafort chose a trial as opposed to a plea deal like his former aide Rick Gates.The case went to the jury on Thursday after 12 days of gripping testimony about hidden bank accounts, betrayal and lavish spending by Manafort on luxury homes, cars, antique rugs and clothes.Prosecutors outlined schemes Manafort allegedly used to avoid paying US taxes on the millions of dollars he earned in Ukraine, saying he also filed false statements to obtain millions of dollars in loans from banks when his Ukraine consulting fees dried up.Defense attorneys sought for their part to cast doubt on the credibility of the prosecution's star witness, Manafort's former trusted deputy Gates, who took a deal from the government and turned against his former boss.Trump spent much of Tuesday cooped up at the White House, as two high-profile legal cases with profound implications for his presidency played out on US television screens.Barely minutes after the Manafort verdict was announced, Trump's longtime personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty in Manhattan court to eight counts, including fraud and campaign finance violations.Questioned by a federal judge, Cohen indicated he had paid sums of US$130,000 and US$150,000 each to two women who claimed they had affairs with Trump, at his boss's request in order to buy their silence \"with the purpose of influencing the election.\""},

There are about 350 MAX 8 planes currently in service around the world.Air Canada, for example, announced it was canceling flights to London following Britain's decision to ban the aircraft.The EU\u00a0aviation safety agency also closed European airspace to all MAX planes.It noted that the \"exact causes\" of the Lion Air crash were still being investigated.\"At this early stage of the related investigation, it cannot be excluded that similar causes may have contributed to both events,\" the agency added.'PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE'India joined the list of countries to ban the jet, a day after saying it had imposed additional interim safety requirements for ground engineers and crew for the aircraft.Elsewhere, Turkish Airlines, one of the largest carriers in the world, said it was suspending use of its 12 MAX aircraft from Wednesday, until \"uncertainty\" was clarified.Low-cost airline Norwegian Air Shuttle, South Korea's Eastar Jet and South Africa's Comair also said they would halt flights.The developments sent Boeing shares tumbling another six percent, after a five percent drop Monday, wiping billions off its market value.US President Donald Trump weighed in with a blistering tweet: \"Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly.\"\"Pilot are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT,\" he wrote, referring to the prestigious university.Trump later spoke by telephone to Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, who assured him the aircraft is safe, an industry source told AFP.US carriers have so far appeared to maintain confidence in Boeing, which has been ordered by the FAA to make changes to flight systems and pilot training procedures.The move was not enough to reassure the UK Civil Aviation Authority, which said it was banning the planes from UK airspace \"as a precautionary measure.\"Global air travel hub Singapore, as well as Australia, Malaysia and Oman, were among the other countries to ban all MAX planes from their airspace.Vietnam joined them on Wednesday, the country's civil aviation authority said.There are currently no 737 MAX planes in operation by Vietnam carriers, though budget carrier Vietjet has ordered 200 of the model and were expected to receive initial deliveries in the first quarter of this year.China, a hugely important market for Boeing, has ordered domestic airlines to suspend operations of the plane.'SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY IMPACT'Boeing has described the MAX series as its fastest-selling family of planes, with more than 5,000 orders placed to date from about 100 customers.But not since the 1970s -\u00a0when the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 suffered successive fatal incidents -\u00a0has a new model been involved in two deadly accidents in such a short period.Thomas Anthony, head of the Aviation Safety and Security Program at the University of Southern California, said increasing automation of planes means crews have less experience flying manually.\"So it's not just a mechanical, it is not just a software problem, but it is a problem of communication and trust,\" he said.The plane involved in Sunday's crash was less than four months old, with Ethiopian Airlines saying it was delivered on November 15.It went down near the village of Tulu Fara, some 60 kilometres\u00a0east of Addis Ababa.Ethiopian Airlines chief executive Tewolde GebreMariam said the plane had flown in from Johannesburg, spent three hours in Addis and was \"dispatched with no remark,\" meaning no problems were flagged.Investigators have recovered the black box flight recorders, which could potentially provide information about what happened, depending on their condition."},

Indeed, an area twice the size of India would have to be planted in biofuel crops.This \"P4\" plan also assumes that some 1200 billion tonnes of CO2 - 30 years' worth of emissions at current rate - will be socked away underground.Signficantly, and for the first time, the UN panel quantified changes in the use of coal, oil and gas.For the low-energy demand pathway, for example, coal consumption would drop 78 per cent by 2030, and 97 per cent by mid-century. Oil would decline by 37 and 74 per cent, respectively, and gas by 25 and 74 per cent.The pathway of least resistance, by contrast, would still see nearly a doubling of oil use by 2030, and a 37 jump in gas.Coal is a big loser in all the scenarios.The US delegation - the first since Donald Trump took office to work on an IPCC report - did not throw a monkey wrench into the process, as many here had feared.\"The United States is quite constructive, though I don't think they want that said out loud,\" said on delegate who asked not to be named.Besides special reports, the IPCC has issued five major Assessment Reports that serve as the scientific foundation for UN climate talk. The next one is due in 2022."},

Most of the rest rely on social media.PANICKED HEADLINES BUT EFFECTS LIKELY TO BE 'MINOR'Timing matters, too. That is another area where the US president has succeeded.\n    AdvertisementWhile there is no good time for a trade war, this is about as good a moment as any. The US economy grew 2.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2018, and some analysts are predicting 3 per cent, or even higher, for the second quarter, which ends this month.The majority of the gains in wealth from the growth have flowed to the top 10 per cent of the US population. That is because they own 80 per cent of stock and US companies are mainly channelling the money they have saved from lower corporate taxes into share buybacks (or in the case of Google and some other tech companies, prime real estate in coastal markets).But in the short term, that wealth effect, which according to Goldman Sachs may be responsible for as much as a third of US growth today, will help offset the negative effects of trade battles.On that score, there have been panicked headlines about the US$50 billion in US tariffs against Chinese goods that the president imposed last week, as well as retaliatory measures from Beijing.But many economists say that the near-term effects are likely to be minor, perhaps as little as one-tenth of a percentage point drag on growth per year for each country over a five-year period.Of course, those projections depend on models that cannot tabulate all the potential knock-on effects of tariffs.As we have already seen with Chinese telecoms equipment maker ZTE, the supply chain connections between China and the US are deep and complex. The company was nearly driven out of business after the US banned it from buying crucial American components.

It is not a great idea to fight both allies and adversaries at once.President Trump could have found ways to combine looking tough for his political base with smart trade and foreign policy.Rather than carry out his campaign promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, he could have worked with the EU to challenge China\u2019s trade policies at the World Trade Organisation. He also could have worked privately with US allies, while still posturing publicly about getting tough on China.All this would have made much more sense to the global elite. But the American president really does not give a hoot about what the Davos crowd thinks.Mr Trump has done exactly what he said he would do while running for president. He has got tough on China. He has got tough on immigrants.

International co-operation does not come naturally to them. And yet, despite this, the world is seeing the emergence of a \u201cnationalist international\u201d.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementNationalist political parties are on the rise across the west \u2014 and they are taking inspiration from each other and working together.Donald Trump is central to this development. The US president is often portrayed as an isolated maverick on the world stage. But, in fact, he is emerging as the informal leader of an international movement. By shifting American politics in a more nationalist direction, Mr Trump has changed the tone of politics everywhere.IDEOLOGICAL SOULMATESThe US president already has ideological soulmates in Europe, where the key figures include Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary (who came to power before Mr Trump), and Matteo Salvini, Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementEurope\u2019s nationalists include far-right parties that are now in coalition governments, such as Mr Salvini\u2019s League and Austria\u2019s Freedom Party.\u00a0But nationalist themes have also been increasingly adopted by more traditional centre-right parties, such as Germany\u2019s\u00a0Christian Social Union (CSU), Britain\u2019s Conservatives and Austria\u2019s People\u2019s party.READ:\u00a0Why Hungary's Viktor Orban\u00a0is closing one of Europe's top-ranking, richest universities, a commentary.READ:\u00a0Turkey's Recep Erdogan won the elections but a more diverse parliament opens a new phase for the country, a commentary.\n    AdvertisementThe nationalists\u2019 dominant issue is usually immigration \u2014 and the need to defend the nation against \u201cswarms\u201d of migrants from outside the west. When it comes to economics, they are often drawn to Trump-style protectionism.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nItaly's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini looks on during the news conference at the Viminale in Rome, Italy, June 20, 2018. (Photo: REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini)\n                            \n\n                    \n                These nationalists are also hostile to international institutions and treaties, which they regard as the playthings of a rootless, global elite.The Trump administration has withdrawn from international treaties such as the Paris climate accord, and organisations like the UN Human Rights Council. The European nationalists focus their ire on the EU and the international rules governing the treatment of refugees.READ:\u00a0The exorbitant costs of America going it alone, a commentary.Increasingly, they are looking to cooperate.Sebastian Kurz, Austria\u2019s chancellor, has mused about organising a \u201cBerlin-Rome-Vienna\u201d axis to fight illegal immigration. Richard Grenell, the US ambassador in Germany, has talked about empowering Trump-style \u201cconservatives\u201d across Europe. Steve Bannon, Mr Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, convened meetings of nationalist parties in Rome during the Italian elections, writing later:It\u2019s hard not to feel we\u2019re on the right side of history.The nationalists are often fans of Vladimir Putin. The Russian president is admired as a tough guy who sticks up for his nation. His violation of international laws in the process is regarded as a plus \u2014 not a minus.By contrast, the nationalists detest Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, who are seen as preachy internationalists, hopelessly soft-headed on the defining issue of immigration.PROGRESSING NATIONALISMThis nationalism is not confined to the west. In Delhi, recently, I had a long conversation with Jayant Sinha, a government minister. He argued that the Modi government rejects universalism, in favour of a defence of India\u2019s unique culture.\u201cPeople feel their heritage is under siege,\u201d he said, \u201cin that sense we are part of a global narrative.\u201dMany liberal internationalists find it hard to accept that the nationalists are making progress partly because they have some genuine political insights.Their emphasis on the enduring importance of the nation-state clearly resonates with voters. Demands for tougher control of illegal migration flow naturally from that idea \u2014 since the question of who is entitled to citizenship is central to national identity.Europe\u2019s nationalists, such as Mr Salvini, Mr Orban and Britain\u2019s Nigel Farage, have capitalised on complaints that the EU grabbed too many of the traditional powers of the nation and controls everything from national budget deficits to citizenship rights.The central demands of the new nationalists, such as control of immigration or protectionism, have a legitimate place in democratic politics. But the policies adopted by them, once they are in power, have quickly spun off into horrifying directions, such as the detention of migrant children in the US or Mr Salvini\u2019s demand for a mass expulsion of the Roma population from Italy.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nSalvadoran migrant Epigmenio Centeno and his sons pose for a photograph outside the shelter House of the Migrant, after Epigmenio decided to stay with his children in Mexico due to U.S. President Donald Trump's child separation policy, in Ciudad Juarez.\u00a0\n                            \n\n                    \n                A WORLD PRIMED FOR CONFLICTOne key problem is that the nationalist emphasis on the nation-state usually has a strong cultural and racial element.Once you start thinking of outsiders as less worthy than your compatriots \u2014 indeed, as people who \u201cinfest\u201d your nation (in the words of President Trump) \u2014 than it becomes much easier to treat them brutally.A second problem is that the new nationalists often ignore the complexity of the modern world.International rules are not simply the product of the ideological preferences of an unmoored globalist elite. They are the necessary means to regulate the interactions of nations on everything from trade to travel.Abolish all those fussy international laws and you are on the route to anarchy, a trade war \u2014 or a real war.So while the nationalists are making common cause in taking on their liberal internationalist foes around the world, the \u201cnationalist international\u201d is intrinsically unstable.

Before the Singapore summit, reports surfaced that the CIA assessed it did not believe North Korea would ever denuclearise.The North Koreans, always keen observers, have what they believe is a winning game plan, to bypass the bureaucrats and appeal directly to Trump.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has dealt with Pyongyang in a diplomatic as well as intelligence capacity as former CIA director, is the most experienced on North Korean affairs in the president\u2019s cabinet.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrives at Sunan International Airport in Pyongyang, North Korea, July 6, 2018.

Trump responded by calling the letter \u201cvery nice\u201d and declared that \u201cprogress is being made,\u201d despite making no references to denuclearisation \u2013 the very meaning of which has yet to be set out in these negotiations.\n    AdvertisementPyongyang did not even have to deny the intelligence findings. Trump expressed his confidence that Kim Jong Un will honour their deal because of their contract and \u201cmore importantly,\u201d their handshake.This method of conducting international relations on a strictly personal basis plays right into Pyongyang\u2019s hands. Trump\u2019s brushing off intelligence reports undermines the massive effort required by the US government to hold North Korea accountable during this delicate detente.The US has the most sophisticated information gathering apparatus in the world, but its value is lost if the president doesn\u2019t use it.PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPSPersonal relationship-based diplomacy can also be chaotic. The world has seen how quickly leaders can fall in and out of favour with the mercurial American president, and although Trump says he trusts Kim now, if he later feels personally betrayed, the response may be frightening.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe historic handshake between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump lasted some 13 seconds AFP/SAUL LOEB\n                            \n\n                    \n                The \u201cfire and fury\u201d of 2017 seems like a distant memory, but tensions can return quickly.Additionally, the maximum pressure the US used against North Korea in 2017 was successful in no small part because of help from the international community, especially China.Replicating this will be extremely unlikely considering that Beijing has already begun re-establishing broken economic ties with North Korea, holding summits with its leaders, and facing off against the US in a trade war.South Korea, a key ally and intermediary with North Korea, is also enjoying its own hard-fought rapprochement with Pyongyang.Any measures against North Korea now by the US would certainly be unilateral, minus constraining factors of 2017, but with the addition of traditional hawks such as National Security Adviser John Bolton in the administration.With a handshake and flattery, Kim Jong Un has been able to maintain Trump\u2019s trust publicly while covertly continuing its weapons programmes.Until that trust with the American leader runs out, North Korea can have its proverbial cake and eat it too.Nate Kerkhoff is a Master's Candidate at Yonsei Graduate School for International Studies and a Young Scholar at the Pacific Forum.

Indeed, that may well have been its purpose.SUCCESS FOR RUSSIAFor the Russian leader, the meeting, like the just-concluded World Cup, was a success. Trump\u2019s failure to condemn Russia\u2019s 2016 election meddling \u2013 essentially siding with Moscow against his own intelligence agencies \u2013 and his description of US Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe as a \u201cdisaster\u201d is a win for Putin.And while the US indictment of a dozen Russian intelligence officers two days before the meeting clearly infuriated the US president, it didn\u2019t deter him from treating Russia and Putin as an equal negotiating partner.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementTrump, presumably, sees the fact he faced down his own critics, grabbed the agenda and dominated European news during last week\u2019s NATO summit and UK visit as a clear political victory.The US president revels in negotiating with tough, autocratic foreign leaders, with whom he appears to identify more than most of his democratically-elected counterparts.Both Moscow and Pyongyang probably now have similar visions of how their relations with the US administration might develop \u2013 a series of high-profile periodic meetings in which little is given up or gained, but in which dialogue continues.READ:\u00a0Trump-Putin summit: Five key takeaways\n    AdvertisementREAD:\u00a0The exorbitant cost of America going it alone, a commentary\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS President Donald Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin held a joint press conference after meeting in Helsinki on July 16, 2018 AFP/Brendan Smialowski\n                            \n\n                    \n                Other Western leaders, however, are less certain where to go.TRUMP DOESN\u2019T CARE WHAT OTHERS THINK OF HIMThe truth may well be, of course, that Trump doesn\u2019t care what non-Americans think of him. Much of the theatre of the early part of his trip \u2013 particularly at the NATO summit in Brussels \u2013 appeared designed to play to his base.Trump made noise, hit the key arguments he wanted, particularly on European defence spending. Then he declared success and claimed that his opponents had climbed down.Judging by comments by French President Emmanuel Macron and others, the reality may be more complex. During the NATO summit, there does not appear to have been a Trump-brokered agreement to significantly hike European defense spending.If European states do choose such a step, it will be as much for their own reasons \u2013 frustration with America and more specifically, fear that Washington will remain chronically unreliable and unpredictable \u2013 as anything else.EUROPE LEARNING TO MANAGE TRUMPMost European leaders have little enthusiasm for the U president, and know their own political bases relish it when they oppose him. Those leaders who believe they need the United States most \u2013 such as British Prime Minister Theresa May \u2013 are developing their own tactics for managing him.May all but ignored Trump\u2019s blisteringly undiplomatic interview with a British tabloid newspaper last week, in which he savaged her Brexit approach.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Theresa May speaks to the press as she arrives at the Alliance's headquarters ahead of the NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium July 11, 2018.

For better or worse, the US president appeared to have increasingly learned how to use the levers of power his office has provided in Washington, despite the opposition of huge swathes of the political, diplomatic and wider\u00a0establishment \u2013 not to mention a polarised electorate.He is now learning to do the same in the outside world, much to the distaste of those who previously advised on more conventional international protocol.The growing European worry, however, remains that Trump\u2019s style is more trend than blip. Trump\u2019s approach may not be a temporary aberration, but the vanguard of a new generation of populists who care little for truth and much for political spectacle \u2013 and an increasingly assertive Russia that backs them.Peter Apps is executive director at the Project for Study of the 21st Century and Reuters\u2019 global affairs columnist."},

These views were central to his campaign, and as president his rhetoric has if anything escalated.\u00a0NAFTA is \u201cthe worst trade deal in the history of the world,\u201d right up there with TPP \u201cwhich is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country.\u201d\u00a0 Germany\u2019s trade policy is \u201cbad, very bad,\u201d and so is South Korea\u2019s and of course so is China\u2019sWhat is remarkable is how long and how consistently Donald Trump has held his anti-trade views.\u00a0In 1987, he spent almost US$100,000 to run full-page ads in the New York Times, Washington Post, and Boston Globe attacking America\u2019s closest allies and the many ways they took advantage of the US, including \u201cvast deficits\u201d and \u201chuge deficits.\u201dEven then, his anti-globalisation ideas were very detailed, and would fit comfortably into a Trump speech today.\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, trade -\u00a0along with Trump\u2019s other signature issue, immigration \u2013 stand out as remarkably stable strands in his worldview. They are two steel rods in the shifting sands of his words and policies, visible through the decades and connecting strongly to Trump\u2019s base.A GLOBAL COMPETITION FOR ADVANTAGEPresident Trump\u2019s long-held trade and immigration views are part and parcel of his signature America First\u00a0policy.\u00a0Just what he means by that phrase was coolly, even chillingly, described by National Security Advisor H R McMaster and (now former) National Economic Advisor Gary D Cohn in a May 30, 2017 Wall Street Journal op-ed.\u00a0It is worth re-reading today.The op-ed is startling in its clarity of purpose and its dramatic shift from the consensus of the (recent) past. President Trump, McMaster and Cohn asserted, brings \u201ca clear-eyed outlook that the world is not a \u2018global community\u2019 but an arena where nations ... compete for advantage.\u201dThis, then, is the Trump Doctrine, and it\u2019s straight from the Hunger Games:\u00a0 The world is an arena of actors competing for advantage, to which America will bring all of its strength -\u00a0 military, political, economic \u2013 for American advantage.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nSino-US trade relations have come into even sharper focus under President Donald Trump, who frequently calls out China over its trade policies.

Trump.\u00a0 And he wants maximum flexibility to act.\u00a0As he pushes for America First, he will also seek to dismantle the rules-based trading order in favour of one where he is able to act without restraint and with maximum discretion.TARIFFS SHOW HIS PREFERRED APPROACHThe past week has given us two perfect examples of his preferred approach. The steel and aluminum tariffs are being imposed based on vaguely-worded notions of \u201cnational security.\u201d In the signing ceremony for the new tariffs, Trump noted that he will \u201c(show) great flexibility and cooperation toward those that really are friends of ours, both on a trade basis and a military basis.\u201dHe immediately exempted Mexico and Canada (temporarily, and based on good behavior in the NAFTA talks).\u00a0He also signalled he would exempt Australia because they are \u201cgood friends,\u201d and was working with Prime Minister Turnbull on an undefined \u201csecurity agreement\u201d so that \u201cwe don\u2019t have to impose ... tariffs on our ally, the great nation of Australia.\u201dThe president indicated US trade representative Robert Lighthizer would decide on exemptions \u2013 but so far no guidelines have been issued or process outlined beyond what he said during the signing ceremony \u2013 that \u201cwe're going to see who's treating us fairly, who's not treating us fairly. Part of that's going to be military. Who's paying the bills, who's not paying the bills.\u201dSince then, the president has been flooded with personal entreaties (and phone calls) from the leaders of Great Britain, France, China, Canada, Argentina and Japan.\u00a0(The Australians apparently enlisted golfing star and Trump friend Greg Norman, and astonishingly it worked).\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS President Donald Trump, seen at a rally Saturday in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, threatened to tax German cars if the EU fails to lower trade barriers.

He has created a new negotiating objective \u2013 tariff exemption \u2013 and invited the leaders of the world to call him to ask for favour.\u00a0Which he will grant, or not, based on his personal relationships.\u00a0(Note that neither Angela Merkel of Germany nor Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico, with whom Trump have testy relations, have spoken to the president \u2013 doubtless they recognise they need others to make their arguments for them.)BLOCKING QUALCOMM\u2019S ACQUISITIONRecent days saw a second unprecedented presidential intervention in international economic relations \u2013 the White House statement blocking the US$117 billion Broadcom-Qualcomm acquisition because \u201cit could impair the national security of the United States\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0Never before has a president intervened in a CFIUS review in this manner. The administrative review was in its early stages, and typically problematic transactions are allowed to die quietly in the dark.\u00a0Instead, the president chose to prove that he is the man in the arena.What reasons underlay the blocking of the transaction?\u00a0We don\u2019t know; and Singaporeans know best of all that Broadcom may have been Singapore-licensed but was headquartered in and operated from California. This was a merger of two global companies based in the US, not a foreign takeover.What precedent does this action set?\u00a0 Truly, we don\u2019t know \u2013 and that\u2019s just how Trump likes it.\u00a0Where does all this leave Singapore?\u00a0 Singapore has long embraced \u2013 indeed built its entire economy around \u2013 a rules-based international order.

It often has value-added from US firms with operations in China, as well as from parts suppliers in Japan and South Korea for instance.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementHence, in any trade war between the United States and China, there will be collateral damage on third countries.The United States has published its list of products from China that would be hit with 25 per cent tariffs in response to the investigation under Section 301 of the 1974 US Trade Act, which authorises the president to respond (including via retaliation) to a foreign government action that violates an international trade agreement and that burdens or restricts US commerce.There is a 60-day comment period before any tariffs go into effect.The 301 investigation examined China\u2019s unfair trading practices and, in particular, issues of intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer for US companies operating in China.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementWHERE TO IMPOSE TARIFFS?In choosing which imports to punish, Washington faces a dilemma.\u00a0On the face of it, it would make sense to target high-tech industries that benefit from technology transfer.However, these tend to be the industries in which Chinese value-added has the lowest share. In the case of computers and electronic equipment, for example, less than half the value added in Chinese exports comes from China. The rest is value-added imported from other countries, including the United States.\n    AdvertisementIt should also be noted that these industry classifications are quite broad. Within computers and electronic equipment, there is a vast array of different products. Some of the products exported from China have very little domestic value-added, less than 10 per cent.Furthermore, in computers and electronics, more than half of China\u2019s exports come from multinational firms operating in China. This is a separate issue from domestic versus foreign value-added.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA woman working in a factory in Jiangsu province.

But the firms earn substantial profits from these operations, and that is a benefit for US and other foreign owners.China\u2019s industrial policies are often aimed at building up China\u2019s state-owned enterprises (SOEs). But these firms hardly export at all. In 1995, SOEs accounted for almost half of China\u2019s exports; by 2015 that figure had dropped to low single digits.There are some sectors in which China\u2019s exports consist primarily of domestic value-added. These tend to be old industrial sectors. In textiles, for example, 75 per cent of value added is really \u201cmade in China\u201d.If Washington wants to limit collateral damage on its own firms and third countries, then it makes sense to go after an old sector like textiles.HURTING US FIRMSUS firms are also involved in production chains - 37 per cent of US imports from China are intermediate products used by American firms to make themselves more competitive.Putting tariffs on intermediate products is shooting oneself in the foot. The list of targeted products posted by the United States includes some intermediates, such as aircraft propellers.Many of the targeted products are consumer goods such as televisions and dishwashers. When a large country such as the United States imposes tariffs, the pain is shared between consumers who pay higher prices and producing firms abroad who have to absorb lower profit margins.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nWorkers loading imported soybeans -\u00a0targeted for tariffs by China in its trade dispute with Washington - at a port in Nantong in China's eastern Jiangsu province on Apr\u00a04, 2018.

Some of the cost will be borne by American consumers; some by American firms that either produce in China or use intermediate products from China; some by firms in countries (mostly US allies) that supply China; and some by Chinese firms (mostly private ones).If the United States proceeds with the 301 tariffs, China can be expected to retaliate based on its past behavior. In fact, it quickly published its own list, including penalising US soybean and aircraft exports.READ:\u00a0A commentary on China\u2019s growth strategy in peril as trade war looms.The same analysis can be applied to Chinese retaliatory tariffs. Chinese consumers will pay more for soybeans and products like pork that rely on soybeans. Chinese airlines will be less productive if they cannot buy American aircraft.It happens that these US exports have mostly domestic content, so that most of the pain felt by producers will be within the United States, not in third countries.Overall, tariffs are the wrong instrument to address\u00a0US-China trade issues. Tariffs will cause a lot of unnecessary pain for consumers and third countries, not to mention American firms caught in the crossfire.David Dollar is senior fellow for Foreign Policy, Global Economy and Development at the John L Thornton China Centre.

That would accelerate the shift in the industrial supply chain to China and increase the US\u2019s deficit in trade in goods.\n    Advertisement\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, pictured in April 2018, led high-level talks with China. (Photo: AFP/ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Corporations shift to China because they need to produce cheaply to access the growing Chinese market. But once they have perfected their low-cost production and efficient shipments, there is no reason not to also export that product to other markets, including the US.Even with the rise in Chinese labour costs over the past decade, its wages are much cheaper than other industrialised nations.The highest regional minimum manufacturing wage in China is about US$3 per hour, and wages are much lower in many inland markets. In the US, the federal minimum wage is US$7.25 an hour.A NATIONALIST'S VIEWThe other US goal, personified by Mr Navarro, is harder to negotiate, because the economic nationalists aren\u2019t interested in better investment terms from the Chinese. They want to wrangle corporations whose outsourcing has crippled the American industrial base.The trade actions announced by the Trump administration this year were a shot across the bow in this respect.\u00a0Multinationals who continue to manufacture in low-wage China while selling to better premium markets in north Asia, Europe and North America could see their access to the US market curtailed.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nPeter Navarro rose to fame by publishing anti-Beijing diatribes on trade.

Economic nationalists in Washington want multinationals from the US and elsewhere to stop enabling China\u2019s rise as a strategic competitorWooed by both sides, the multinationals are angling for a better deal.READ:\u00a0A commentary on why soybean farmers are targets of China's retaliation.READ:\u00a0A commentary on how a trade war imperils China's growth strategy.READ:\u00a0A commentary on how the Beijing elite sees the world.COME HOMEOlder, sagging around the middle, less dynamic than it used to be, the US knows it needs to give companies the love they say they want to get them to come home.\u00a0The Trump administration is lowering the corporate tax rate and dismantling environmental regulations to make US investment more attractive. There is less that can be done about the wage differential.Beijing, for its part, swaggers like a younger and more attractive lover. It dangles access to its rapidly growing market as compensation for technology transfer and splitting the profits with its state-owned companies.Multinationals may have resisted in the past but they have been well rewarded for falling in line, to the extent that the China market now matters more to them than many care to admit.Take Chinese telecoms company ZTE. It plays a key role in China\u2019s race to build strategic competitiveness, but for the moment it is also a huge customer for Qualcomm.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nChinese telecoms equipment maker ZTE has been hit with US sanctions.

Mr Trump\u2019s flip-flop on ZTE sanctions is understood in Beijing to reflect the importance of ZTE as a customer to Qualcomm.TOO COCKYBeijing\u2019s big mistake was allowing success to make it too cocky.\u00a0It cut the multinationals too small a slice of the pie when it rolled out the Made in China 2025 industrial leapfrog scheme. It did not listen when friends warned that US companies had soured enough that they were no longer willing to carry China\u2019s brief in Washington.And it blew a chance to kiss and make up when a trade delegation led by commerce secretary Wilbur Ross came to Beijing last summer, and \u201cwon\u201d the same low-hanging fruits China had previously promised the Obama administration.Under the quiet but steely Liu He, China has revised its strategy. It is now announcing the market access initiatives that Wall Street and multinationals have said they wanted.It has cleared stalled merger approvals for Japanese companies, and this weekend agreed to back off on threatened tariffs. Companies have made it clear where their interests lie by loud choruses of support for the Chinese concessions.The weekend\u2019s dual concessions on tariffs have delayed the threat of a trade war.\u00a0Ultimately, the talks will yield a win for one of the two US goals. That, after all, is the point of negotiations.\u00a0But it remains to be seen which one.\u00a9 2018 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Politicizing safety is not a good idea,\" he said.\n    AdvertisementA 737 MAX 8 operating as Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET302 crashed Sunday southeast of Addis Ababa shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 passengers and crew members aboard.The same model - a more fuel-efficient version of the 737 -\u00a0crashed in late October in Indonesia during a flight operated by Lion Air, leaving 189 people dead, also just moments after takeoff.Not since the 1970s -\u00a0when the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 had successive fatal incidents -\u00a0has a new model been involved in two deadly accidents in such a short period.The causes of the crashes are not yet known but the planes' Angle of Attack sensors, which provide data about the angle at which air passes over the wings, have come under scrutiny.BOEING IS 'STRATEGIC'A malfunction could cause the plane's computers to detect a stall incorrectly and put the plane into a dive when it should climb instead.Boeing has sent experts to assist in the investigation and has so far delayed the official roll-out of its new long-haul 777X jet, which had been scheduled for Wednesday.Boeing lamented the crash and said: \"Safety is our number one priority.\"\"The investigation is in its early stages, but at this point, based on the information available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to operators,\" the company said in a statement.The FAA said it would review data and \"if we identify an issue that affects safety, the FAA will take immediate and appropriate action.\"On Wall Street, Boeing shares plunged around 12 per cent earlier in the day, before recovering about half its losses by the close of the trading day.US airlines remain confident in the manufacturer.A person with knowledge of the matter told AFP that American Airlines planned to continue operating flights aboard the company's two dozen 737 MAX 8s as scheduled. And Canadian officials said they would not ground the three aircraft in use by the country's airlines.\"We remain confident in the safety and airworthiness of our fleet of more than 750 Boeing aircraft,\" said a spokesman for Southwest Airlines, which operates a fleet of 34 737 MAX 8 aircraft.Grounding the 737 MAX 8 would be a major setback for Boeing. The aircraft is a key profit driver, with 350 currently in service.When US authorities grounded the Boeing 787 six years ago due to problems with its batteries, only 50 were in operation.The economic fallout would be even greater as Boeing employs more than 150,000 people in the United States, with assembly plants in South Carolina and the state of Washington.As of Friday, it accounted for 11.3 per cent of the benchmark Wall Street stock index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average.This year, Boeing also plans to increase the production rate for the 737 MAX to 57 aircraft per month from 52, in order fill 4,661 orders by January.\"Boeing is strategic, it's a tool of trade,\" said Michel Merluzeau, an analyst at AirInsight.The 737 MAX also figures in the fraught current US-China trade talks, with American officials urging Beijing to purchase more of the jets and cut America's soaring trade deficit with China, according to media reports.In this context, China's decision to ground the 737 MAX is not necessarily related to security concerns, Merluzeau said.In addition to commercial airliners, Boeing also manufactures military aircraft, including the KC-46 Pegasus aerial refueling jet, and is a contractor in US space programmes."},

Its nearest competitor is Brazil, which exported US$21 billion.Meanwhile, China accounts for the lion\u2019s share of global soybean imports at US$34 billion, or two-thirds of the total.American exports made up about a third of that, or US$12.4 billion, making soybeans the US\u2019s second-most valuable export to China after varieties of airplanes.The importance of China as a market for soybeans has been driven by an explosion in demand for meat as consumers switch from a diet dominated by rice to one where pork, poultry and beef play an important part.\u00a0\n    AdvertisementChinese production of meat from those three animals surged 250 per cent from 1986 to 2012 and is projected to increase another 30 percent by the end of the current decade.However, China is unable to produce enough animal feed itself, hence the need to import soybeans from the United States and Brazil.READ:\u00a0A commentary on how\u00a0tariffs are putting China's growth strategy in peril.READ:\u00a0A commentary on why tariffs are the wrong instruments to deal with US-China trade issues.HURTING OHIO FARMERSThat\u2019s why the tariffs have tremendous potential to hurt farmers here in Ohio, where soybeans are the number one agricultural export at US$1.4 billion. China is the state\u2019s largest export market.And Ohio is just the sixth-largest exporter of soybeans, after Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Indiana and Nebraska, all of which will suffer from the tariffs.Not only do farmers stand to lose out by giving up market share to Brazilian farmers, but soybean prices will probably fall as well, hurting incomes and creating a double whammy for midwest farms.This is of course why the Chinese chose to place a tariff on US soybeans in the first place. Farmers will hurt a lot, and soybeans are produced in states where many of them voted for Donald Trump.\u00a0China\u2019s hope, presumably, is that farmers will lobby the administration to step back from the brink of a trade war.Ian Sheldon is chair in agricultural marketing, trade and policy at the Ohio State University.

It supported the country during the Vietnam War and its founding father Kim Il Sung visited\u00a0twice.\u00a0\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementDespite recent stumbles because of Kim Jong Nam\u2019s \"assassination\"\u00a0in Malaysia two years ago, in which a Vietnamese woman was\u00a0involved, North Korea remains one of\u00a0only five communist comrades.On the other hand, the United States has grown to be one of Hanoi\u2019s most important partners \u2013 economically and politically \u2013 in the past two decades,\u00a0while China has become\u00a0increasingly aggressive in its ambitions in Asia.\u00a0To say the least, Vietnam is an optimal destination of a neutral peacemaker.Second, in a point made by former US State Department official Mintaro Oba: \u201cVietnam is logistically convenient, diplomatically viable, and symbolically significant.\u201d\u00a0\n    AdvertisementIt is a manageable distance to Pyongyang, meaning Kim could travel by train via China. That makes security for him less troublesome than would have been if the summit was organised further afield.The Vietnamese authorities have declared that 100 per cent of the police force in Hanoi \u2013 approximately 20,000 \u2013 and an additional elite force of 1,000 personnel from the central government will be responsible for guaranteeing the security of the event.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nRiot police officers stand guard at the Metropole Hotel ahead of the North Korea-U.S. summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, February 27, 2019.

This leads to a significant question: What Vietnam can offer to that process?\u00a0The answer is a lot.VIETNAM EMERGES A MODEL FOR NORTH KOREAThirty years ago, Vietnam was in the same situation as North Korea.\u00a0As the result of its invasion of Cambodia to bring down the Khmer Rouge regime, Hanoi faced blockades by China, European countries, the United States, and Southeast Asian nations. The economy was close to collapse, while its main supporter, the Soviet Union, was also in big trouble.Vietnamese leaders responded by implementing Doi Moi (reforms) in 1986, embracing a market-oriented economy while maintaining a one-party regime.The rest is history: A\u00a0war-devastated country transformed into one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies in three decades. As North Korea seeks to open up its highly centralised economy, it should have a close look at Vietnam\u2019s success.READ:\u00a0Ambitious and smart, youths in Ho Chi Minh are building Asia\u2019s Silicon Valley, a commentaryRecent actions from North Korea suggest\u00a0a willingness to learn.

They know a paper tiger when they see one.The same applies to North Korea. Add in Iran\u2019s response to America\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear deal. And Europe\u2019s reaction to trade threats.WALK AWAY?But there is a steeper cost to America, and to the world, that far outweighs Mr Trump\u2019s immediate self-harm. It comes in two forms. The first is cumulative.The more the US thumbs its nose at the global system that it built, the harder it will be to repair.America\u2019s allies still cling to the hope that Mr Trump is a one-off. Not only will he be replaced by a more conventional president but we need only wait for two and a half years before that happens.Should Mr Trump win again in 2020, the global shock will far exceed his first victory. It would confirm what everyone fears \u2014 that America has made a lasting decision to walk away from the global order it created.

Think of the 1999 Kyoto protocol on global warming. Or the 1956 Anglo-French-Israeli invasion of Suez.The world had already evolved before Mr Trump came to office. His presidency is proof of concept.When Mr Trump withdrew America from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as he did in his first week, the trade deal did not die. It is alive and well.The same applies to the Paris accord on climate change.My bet is that Europe and China will keep the Iran nuclear deal alive too. It is becoming a habit. Allies and adversaries alike are learning how to sustain deals without the US.MOOD SWINGSBut the world must still reckon with Mr Trump\u2019s wild mood swings. His tactics with China are a case in point.Next week Wilbur Ross, US commerce secretary, will try to hammer out a 21st century version of the barter deal. He will ask China to agree long-term contracts to buy American soyabeans, gas, steel and other commodities.Were Mr Ross working for a different president, he would approach China alongside Europe and Japan, America\u2019s main trading partners. They would collectively pressure China to carry out structural reforms.Instead, Mr Trump is threatening punitive sanctions against America\u2019s allies.Meanwhile, China must commit to buying low value-added US goods at the expense of America\u2019s trading partners. Economists call this \u201cmanaged trade\u201d. Non-economists call it a cry for help. It makes a mockery of the rules America created.DANGER OF CONFLICTThe second cost to Mr Trump\u2019s dealmaking is the danger of conflict. There is always the fear he will become a hostage to his own words.In recent weeks he has been basking in coverage of his impending Nobel Prize for disarming North Korea. Now he is learning it was a terrible misunderstanding.Mr Trump only has two modes. Will he pretend not to hear and meet Mr Kim anyway at some point? Or will he revert to a game of nuclear chicken?\u00a0The difference is not trivial.\u00a9 2018 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Regrettably, it is now clear that our call for reform was not heeded.\"The Geneva-based body was established in 2006 to promote and protect human rights worldwide, but its pronouncements and reports have often clashed with US priorities.In particular, the council's focus on Israeli behavior towards Palestinians in the territory it occupies on the West Bank and in Gaza has infuriated Washington.But, as Haley stressed, Washington also believes it comes up short on criticizing even flagrant abuses by US opponents like Venezuela and Cuba.\n    Advertisement\"Countries have colluded with each other to undermine the current method of selecting members,\" Pompeo said.\"And the council's continued and well-documented bias against Israel is unconscionable,\" he said.\"Since its creation, the council has adopted more resolutions condemning Israel than against the rest of the world combined.\"Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the US move, branding the council \"a biased, hostile, anti-Israel organisation that has betrayed its mission of protecting human rights.\"Haley, who issued a warning a year ago that Washington would make good on its threat to leave the council if reforms were not carried through, used even starker language.\"We take this step because our commitment does not allow us to remain a part of a hypocritical and self-serving organisation that makes a mockery of human rights,\" she said.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he regretted Washington's decision, adding: \"The UN's human rights architecture plays a very important role in the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide.\"On Monday, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein -\u00a0a Jordanian -\u00a0had rebuked Trump over the US practice of splitting up migrant families detained on the Mexican border.\"The thought that any state would seek to deter parents by inflicting such abuse on children is unconscionable,\" he said.DEFENDING ISRAELIndependent watchdog Human Rights Watch criticized the move, warning Washington's absence at the council would put the onus on other governments to address the world's most serious rights problems.\"The Trump administration's withdrawal is a sad reflection of its one-dimensional human rights policy: defending Israeli abuses from criticism takes precedence above all else,\" executive director Kenneth Roth said.\"The UN Human Rights Council has played an important role in such countries as North Korea, Syria, Myanmar and South Sudan, but all Trump seems to care about is defending Israel.\"US criticism stems from the fact that Israel is the only country that has a dedicated agenda item, known as Item 7, at the rights council, meaning its treatment of the Palestinians comes under scrutiny at each of the body's three annual sessions.The United States refused to join the body when it was created in 2006, when George W. Bush was in the White House and his ambassador to the UN was John Bolton, Trump's current hawkish and UN-skeptic national security advisor.It was only after Barack Obama came to power that Washington joined the council in 2009.Since Trump took office, the United States has quit the UN cultural agency UNESCO, cut UN funding and announced plans to quit the UN-backed Paris climate agreement."},

However, Erdogan\u2019s AKP (Justice and Development Party) fell short of expectations with 42.5 per cent of the vote, regressing by more than 7 percentage points since November 2015.This translates to 295 seats for the AKP in the parliament, short of the 301 needed for a majority. AKP\u2019s ally the MHP (Nationalist Action Party) received 11.1 per cent of the vote and obtained 49 seats in parliament, compensating somewhat for AKP\u2019s poor performance.The election followed a short but intense campaign that took place under the emergency rule, still in effect after the July 2016 coup attempt. While the outgoing prime minister proudly announced that the election was transparent enough to be a model for other countries, the atmosphere was hardly conducive to a level playing field, considering the opposition\u2019s limited access to the media and state resources.The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which has monitored elections in Turkey, has reported irregularities in past elections, and expressed similar concern ahead of this vote.\u00a0\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementIt will be interesting to see if the new parliament might address these problems and take action to ensure that Turkey\u2019s next elections are, in fact, free and fair.ERDOGAN\u2019S NEXT MOVESThe new composition in parliament, which is somewhat less favourable to Erdogan than before, will bring a new phase.\u00a0While it\u2019s hard to imagine that Erdogan will engage in constructive and compromise-driven politics, the new parliamentary reality \u2014 combined with his past record of pragmatism \u2014 may open room for more pluralistic politics.\n    Advertisement\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nCrowds gathered outside Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) headquarters after results show President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on course for victory.

One of the first tests will be on whether to lift emergency rule, which will say a great deal about where Erdogan and the new parliament stand on the crucial issues of democracy and rule of law.During the campaign, opposition candidates were vocal about their intention to end emergency rule, forcing both Erdogan and his prime minister to entertain the idea as well.Lifting it could end many people\u2019s detentions, including Selahattin Demirta\u015f, the presidential candidate from the mostly Kurdish party HDP who ran his campaign from behind bars, as well as many academics, journalists, and university students being held on spurious terrorism charges. It would also bring about a climate of reconciliation.Erdogan\u2019s approach to the economy will be another important indicator to watch. During the campaign, he blamed external factors and their domestic collaborators for Turkey\u2019s economic woes, which seemed to resonate with voters.Campaign rhetoric, however, will not suffice to bring down inflation or unemployment from their new heights, nor will it fix structural problems such as persistent current account deficits. The Turkish lira has eroded from 2.14 to the US$ when Erdogan was first elected president in August 2014, to 4.68 today, and a serious policy response is needed.Reforming the economy will require close cooperation with parliament and will be linked to reconstituting the rule of law.LONG LIST OF SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY CHALLENGESFinally, Turkey has a long list of foreign policy and security challenges, ranging from the situation in Syria to the poor state of relations with its traditional transatlantic allies.The calls by the opposition candidates to improve relations with the European Union evidently did not resonate decisively with the electorate. Instead, the anti-Western narrative employed by Erdogan and his entourage prevailed.However, it is difficult to see how Turkey can manage the geopolitical challenges in its region, emanating largely from the actions of Iran and Russia, without reforming its foreign policy.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThis handout picture shows Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and his wife Emine Erdogan greeting supporters gathered at the headquarters of his AKP party Ankara as they celebrate his winning five more years in office after a decisive election victory.

Will Erdogan be prepared to tone down his fiery religious nationalism and listen to the voices of reason in parliament that call for improved relations with Europe?This weekend\u2019s vote was, in short, a surprise. Contrary to predictions, Erdogan won decisively, and his new presidential system has received a seal of approval from the electorate.However, the AKP\u2019s failure to secure an absolute majority in parliament is an important message for Erdogan.It remains to be seen whether Erdogan will take this as an opportunity to address the long list of challenges facing Turkey and reconstruct its democracy and economy, and regain the respect that he once enjoyed internationally. The March 2019 municipal elections will be the next test of his performance.Kemal Kirisci is senior fellow for foreign policy at the Centre on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution.

The man who provided CEU with an endowment that is now worth about US$610 million, and who serves as honorary chairman of its board of trustees, is George Soros, a man born in Budapest in 1930 to a Jewish family that survived the war by obtaining false identity documents.Soros immigrated to the UK in 1947, and attended the London School of Economics \u2013 where the open society ideas of the LSE scholar Karl Popper provided a moral and political basis for the rest of his life.\n    AdvertisementHis fabulously successful fund management made him a fortune of many billions \u2013 of which more than US$30 billion have been donated, through his Open Society Foundations, to a range of causes, many of them in Eastern and Central Europe.And it is in these states where he is now presented, by their leaders, as a figure of near-diabolic malignance.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nSoros Fund Management Chairman George Soros speaks during a panel discussion at the Nicolas Berggruen Conference in Berlin on\u00a0Oct\u00a030, 2012. (File photo:\u00a0REUTERS/Thomas Peter)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Stripped to its essentials, Soros espouses the values of radical cosmopolitanism against those of radical nationalism. Above all else, his championing of the needs of the millions of migrants entering, or striving to enter, Europe has roused the fury of the east-central states\u2019 political establishments.And nowhere is this more so than in the country of his birth, where the prime minister, Viktor Orban, has run nationwide advertising campaigns that represented him as a major threat \u2013 and where in elections in April, Orban\u2019s Fidesz party again won over two-thirds of parliamentary seats.Michael Ignatieff, the writer, human rights scholar, former leader of Canada\u2019s Liberal Party and, since 2016, rector of the CEU, tells me he cannot know if he and the CEU must get up and move out of Budapest; no one in government can (or will) tell him what is in their leader\u2019s mind.He has signed a deal to create a campus in Vienna, as a precaution, but he sees the troubles which afflict his charge set on a larger canvas, against the struggles within the European Union for its future.\u201cThe three leading individuals in Europe today are [French President Emmanuel] Macron, [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel \u2026 and Orban. It is a remarkable thing that the prime minister of a country of 10 million people should now be in that position \u2013 it\u2019s a testimony to his strategic tenacity and his vision.\u201dMERKEL, MACRON - DIVERGENCE WITHIN THE EUIgnatieff\u2019s triptych of leaders expresses with some clarity the increasingly divergent views of the EU\u2019s future.In Merkel is the quintessence of steady-as-she-goes, a conservative posture strengthened by the strong swing in the September 2017 elections against the two main parties, Merkel\u2019s own Christian Democratic-Christian Social Union and the Social Democrats, again in coalition but with only a small majority over the resurgent smaller parties, with the far-right Alternative fur Deutschland now the major opposition force.For her, a radical deepening of EU integration risks bolstering the nationalist-populist currents, whose victory in Italy further underpins her caution. Reducing the pressure on EU members to cut debt by reining in public spending means, many inside and outside her party believe, leaves Germany to subsidise lax governance.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. (Photo: AFP/Ludovic Marin)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Macron is the apostle of \u201cprofound transformation\u201d \u2013 necessary, he argues, if the Union\u2019s motor is not to stall, causing it to slide back into a mere collection of states with trade agreements and some cooperation, but guarding their sovereignty and descending into beggar-my-neighbor policies.He needs Merkel\u2019s Germany to refuel and rev up that motor; it has done so for decades, though falteringly in the recent past.Though Merkel has signalled limited support, other states have made clear their disagreements, pressing for an end to integrationist policies, even for a return of powers to national parliaments.ORBAN STANDS FOR SOMETHING ELSEThe Hungarian prime minister stands for something different. As Ignatieff says, he is both strategically tenacious and visionary, and the vision is of separate, sovereign nation states whose allegiance to Europe is based not on an ideal of federalist political union, but of shared cultural norms.Orban has in the past spoken of his preference for an \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d shorn of what he sees as the failed nostrums of multiculturalism, anti-nationalism and open borders.More recently, he has dropped the illiberalism in favor of a \u201cChristian democracy,\u201d but one sharply different from the policies of the Western European Christian and social democratic parties, whom he regards as effete.His would be instead a reassertion of a Christianity defined as a church militant, opposing the dilution of its religious values by alien, even hostile forces. Europe, seen by EU founders and their descendants as an open society, becomes more of a fortress.No wonder, then, that Soros and all his works should be identified as an enemy.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban adjusts his tie before addressing parliament in Budapest Hungary on\u00a0May 18, 2018. (Photo: REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Visions need practical underpinnings. Hungary, nearly thirty years after the end of communism, is largely successful economically, but increasingly constrained politically.Notably, the opposition news media are in crisis, starved of state advertising, avoided by domestic and foreign companies reluctant to upset a powerful government.Politics lean heavily to the anti-immigrant right: Second to Fidesz in the April poll was Jobbik, a far-right party which, though it has made efforts to moderate its raw anti-Semitism, remains as hostile to immigration (and to Soros) as the governing Fidesz.To talk to oppositionists is to encounter men and women who had hoped the elections would see some resurgence of the liberal and leftist parties \u2013 only to see a further decline.Orban bolsters his dominance by weakening the institutions of the opposition \u2013 aided by their inability to unite, or to find a leader with as compelling a vision in contrast to his.Macron, Merkel and Orban: These three remain. At present, as Central Europe reflects his views, as Italy\u2019s new government shares many of them, as Britain continues its march to the exit and, as many more states recoil from than share Macron\u2019s views, the greatest of these may be Orban.John Lloyd co-founded the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford, where he is senior research fellow.

So what can we do?The solution has been clear for more than two decades: Governments must take aggressive action to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The extreme weather lends greater urgency to climate change initiatives like those under the Paris Agreement.An essential key to meeting\u00a0the challenge of extreme weather is critical environmental intelligence.\u00a0Just like the intelligence of the security world, intelligence in the environmental arena combines data, analysis, modelling, and assessment.The smart approach to extreme weather is to attack all the risk factors, by designing crops that can survive drought, buildings that can resist floods and high winds, policies that discourage people from building in dangerous places - and of course, by shifting our economy to greener energy sources and reducing\u00a0our greenhouse-gas emissions.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe Paris Agreement commits signatories to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, which is blamed for melting ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels and more violent weather events. (Photo:\u00a0AFP)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Singapore has taken steps to reduce the impact of extreme weather events by improving drainage to reduce flood-prone areas, developing weather-proof technologies, and cooling the island by growing urban green spaces such as rooftop gardens.Where climate change poses a real danger,\u00a0we cannot take the attitude that it\u2019s someone else\u2019s job to sort out.\u00a0Indeed, the biggest challenge we must guard against in this battle against climate change is people tuning out to the message about global warming.Erik Solheim mentioned this when he said:\u00a0For this to happen, we\u00a0have to speak in a different language that is simpler and breaks down the science to explain to people what climate change really means for them, in their daily lives, here and now.As individuals, we should seize everyday opportunities to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. We can recycle, reuse and reduce. Whenever we can, we should use public transport and walk.Quite literally, small steps can lead to large-scale change when we, citizens of the earth, act together.Professor Benjamin P Horton is principal investigator at the Earth Observatory of Singapore at Nanyang Technological University."},

Interest rate cuts such as that by the US Federal Reserve will have only a limited countervailing impact. Governments must also be ready to loosen fiscal policies.Whether slowdown turns to recession will depend on how fast and far the virus spreads during coming months.

The rest becomes discarded trash, left to burn or be put in landfills.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementWorldwide, humans have created over 9.2 billion tonnes of plastic since the 1950s, scientists revealed in 2017, and only 25 per cent were recycled.The popularity of plastic stems from its wide-ranging functions that satisfy consumer needs.\u00a0It is relatively inexpensive to produce, but the extraction of finite resources to produce them, whether oil, natural gas or coal, and an undervaluation of its utilisation have sparked discussions aplenty against plastic consumption.READ:\u00a0Dear Singapore, a plastic future is not fantastic, a commentary\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementMany staunch environmentalists have discouraged key kinds of plastic use, often citing the environmental issues it creates, and experts too have warned of the adverse effects plastic has on the ocean.An effort to prevent further degradation of the environment and the ocean, recycling is not a bad option. But this is missing the forest for the trees.Recycling plastic might slow the rate of environmental degradation, but a more effective approach is for each and every one of us to rethink our lifestyles and abstain from the use of plastics, particularly disposables.The process of sorting out recyclable plastics from contaminated plastics that cannot be recycled is cumbersome and labour-intensive.

Unfortunately, the convenience and low cost of using disposable plastics, as well as a habit of using plastics for many decades now have ingrained a certain psyche in most of us.THE OCEAN NEEDS PROTECTION The consumption of plastics depletes a finite resource and doubles the emission of greenhouse gases.\u00a0Crude oil, a fossil fuel, is a key ingredient for producing different kinds of plastics, from the extremely durable to the malleable, and its distillation consumes energy and adds to greenhouse emissions.READ:\u00a0Guess how many countries are meeting their climate change commitments? A commentaryAt the end of its shelf life, plastics do not degrade completely. Even though large pieces can be broken down to smaller plastics, microplastic debris are easily swept into the sea where they remain in perpetuity.\u00a0This degrades the ocean and compromises its sink function \u2013 which is critical in absorbing emissions from economic activities. It is likely that no part of the ocean has been left untouched by plastic pollution.Although plastic in Singapore is usually burnt and left in landfills, and might not find its way into the ocean, this is not the case elsewhere. Scientists from the non-profit advocacy group 5 Gyres reported in 2014, that the world\u2019s ocean is infested with an estimate of 5.24 trillion pieces of plastic.The ocean is a precious environmental resource, but the invasion of the marine habitat not only disrupts our global natural ecosystem, but also kills wildlife. Just last month, 40 kg of plastic trash was found in a stomach of a dead whale that was washed ashore in the Philippines.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA total of 40kg\u00a0of plastic, including grocery bags and rice sacks were found in the whale's stomach.

Admittedly, it is impossible to abstain from plastics, though, its use can be averted.For instance, if plastic bags are made inaccessible, people may rethink consumption patterns. Adding a price tag to use plastic bags could coerce consumers to consider trade-offs and bear the cost of convenience.Singapore can draw inspiration from the Netherlands \u2013 the Dutch government has, since January 2016, banned free plastic bags, and made it compulsory for consumers to be charged about 0.25 euros (S$0.38) for each. The country saw some 71 per cent drop in plastic bag use. This shows that price signals and jolting do influence behaviours.ECO-FRIENDLY PACKAGINGThe Carbon Pricing Act (CPA) which came into effect this year may lead to producers charging a premium for plastics-related product.Increasing the price of plastic products could make businesses choose less plastic, but it does not equate to no pollution, nor will it reduce the accumulated carbon load. Some businesses would still choose to sell products with elaborate plastic packaging to satisfy the \u201cconsumerist culture\u201d.Further, elements of cleanliness and safety play a significant role in influencing societal affinity to plastics. Simple paper packaging, although kinder to the environment, may be costlier and could hurt their businesses.Policies should aim to advance the uptake of environmentally friendly products and encourage businesses to use recycled materials instead of pristine plastic. Producers should be incentivised to meet consumers\u2019 demand for minimal, functional and eco-friendly packaging.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA huge array of goods and packaging we use in our everyday lives is made of plastic (Photo: AFP/JEAN-MICHEL ANDRE)\n                            \n\n                    \n                There is a need for an emphasis on close-loop values to minimise wastages but at some point, we must foster an understanding that waste can be feedstock.With technological advancements, innovative bio-based plastics and eco-friendly plastics have been developed and employed. The use of these materials can help to minimise waste and make progress towards a circular economy where used plastic becomes feedstock.READ:\u00a0Why recycling, less single-use plastics are not the answers to our plastic scourge, a commentaryIT\u2019S NOT JUST ABOUT RECYCLINGPlastic contamination did not occur overnight nor will it diminish overnight. Deliberations should not fixate on recycling. On the contrary, it should stress on how plastics enter our environment.Societal thought leaders can spearhead capacity-building through intellectual platforms such as the International Conference on Plastics in the Marine Environment, which last year saw international experts gather in Singapore to discuss issue of plastic debris in the marine environment, and initiatives like the Blue Economy - which promotes sustainable use of ocean resources in economic growth - and the Blue Plan.The latter had proposed recommendations, in a gathering of more than 100 environmentalists, on ways to better protect the marine ecosystem in Singapore.While Singapore has made huge strides in instilling public awareness and engagement as well as encouraging recycling with initiatives such as the National Recycling Programme, and the provision of recycling bins to all HDB blocks and landed homes, it\u2019s worth looking beyond recycling.After all, apart from the energy needed to sort and recycle plastics, the reality is that, 40 per cent of the load collected from blue recycling bins in Singapore are tainted \u2013 and these tainted recyclables have likely end up in the incinerator. So, it is not just about recycling.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nFile photo of a recycling bin in Singapore.

So what then can be done?OUR BADLY NEEDED RE-EDUCATION\u00a0While making plastic inaccessible or promoting more use of eco-friendly packaging can help reduce plastic use, these are unfortunately short term remedies. Long-term solution requires education, or more so, re-education \u2013 to increase societal awareness.There is a need to re-educate society to appreciate and conserve our environment.Consumers need to be more plastic-conscious so that their actions become less intrusive to the environment. Producers should prioritise consumer-centric design packaging\u00a0that is minimal, functional, and if possible, plastic-free.For now, we can\u2019t wipe away all the plastic that we have, but a business credit system towards good environmental behaviour can be imposed. \u00a0If society can be re-educated and informed, they can alter old habits and change their lifestyles to wean off plastics.Moving away from a consumerist culture may gain traction if we can first recognise the ills of being a plastic-dependent society. This will need moral suasion and a steadfast environmental stewardship.As individuals, we must recognise that using plastics is an irrational choice that compromises not just our well-being but our children\u2019s future.\u00a0So we have to start now and adopt a mantra to minimise plastic use, not just waste.\u00a0Societal attitude is the chief suspect behind our plastic waste problem \u2013 so recycling clearly cannot be the solution.\u00a0\u00a0Seck Tan\u00a0is assistant professor at\u00a0Singapore Institute of Technology.

They are all under pressure to define their purpose and posture at a time when trust in capitalism and liberal democracy has fallen.\n    AdvertisementCompanies, like liberals, are finding it much easier to speak out about social wrongs, real or perceived, than to correct economic ones.

Just look at the demise of Sears, a company whose assets were stripped to pay investors while Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, sat on the board.Between 2005 and 2012, Sears spent US$6 billion on stock buybacks, even though it generated only US$1.8 billion in operating cash. This is a company that, in its glory days, was proud to share 10 per cent of its profits with its workers.Amazon, the new Sears, has increased the minimum wage for its workers to US$15 an hour after Mr Sanders put pressure on them. But it also stopped awarding share options to warehouse staff. I\u2019m guessing founder Jeff Bezos came out ahead on that deal.ECONOMIC ISSUES REMAIN TOP OF MINDEven as politicians and businesses focus on identity, economic issues remain top of most voters\u2019 minds. Out of pocket spending on healthcare increased 8.5 per cent last year, four times faster than inflation, and polls show that that issue is much more important to most Americans than which gender uses which bathroom.Some people will vote against Republicans on Tuesday (Nov 6) based on righteous fury about President Donald Trump\u2019s handling of last year\u2019s racist and violent protests in Charlottesville, his administration\u2019s treatment of immigrant children, or his general misogyny.But if you dig deeper, the longer-term disputes have to do with economics.The biggest political divide in the US is between working-class white men who vote Republican and college-educated female Democrats. I believe this is less about gender and more about an economy in which two-thirds of the decently paid jobs being created require at least two years of college.Democrats are doing well anywhere that is within 20 minutes of a Whole Foods (an upscale grocery store, owned by Amazon, that even my prosperous neighbours call \u201cWhole Paycheque\u201d).

They will have to convince both corporate executives and the corporate wing of their own party to get on board.Most Americans, liberal and conservative, are united in their definition of what constitutes \u201cjust\u201d business behaviour \u2014 they believe it is about spreading the wealth, and improving worker pay and treatment.It would be wise for both politicians and business to focus on those ideas that bring people together, rather than those that drive them apart.\u00a9 2018 The Financial Times Ltd.

Silence allows others to frame the issues and control the narrative.As a result, Boeing has found itself playing defence to a storyline that suggests the company was more interested in profits than people in the rush to produce an aircraft that accounts for about a third of its revenue.That narrative is being pushed by other airlines, media, employees and airplane safety advocates like Captain Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger.BEING PROACTIVEBoeing could have adopted a proactive approach, such as by taking the initiative to ground its own planes.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nGround crew members escort a Boeing 737 MAX as it returns from a flight test at Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington, on\u00a0Jan\u00a029, 2016.

Boeing failed in all three regards.And the few statements it has issued are chock-full of platitudes \u2013 such as \u201csafety is a core value\u201d \u2013 and lack meaningful information. In its statement after the FAA grounded the 737 Max, Boeing suggested it was complying \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d But Boeing didn\u2019t have a choice. The decision was made.READ:\u00a0What\u2019s behind China\u2019s swift action to ground Boeing 737 MAX flights? A commentaryBoeing is now on the defensive and, going forward, will have to counter the damaging narrative circulating in the court of public opinion. It has its work cut out for it. Research shows that people are quick to believe the worst about organisations, which feeds negative speculation.TURBULENCE AHEADThe challenge Boeing faces is serious.Many of its planes continue to be grounded, which could cost Boeing as much as US$5 billion, according to early estimates. Boeing has paused delivery on the 737 Max and orders for future planes are at risk \u2013 it recently received its first public cancellation. The company has about 4,500 of the airplanes on order.Boeing does have one thing in its favour. The company has built strong relationships with government officials in Washington over the years.But those relationships, which could be useful and shield the company to some degree, are now under stress as Congress and the Justice Department investigate how Boeing got the 737 Max certified to fly.LISTEN: The debate over the Boeing 737 MAX 8, an episode on The Pulse podcastTURNING THINGS AROUNDSo is it too late to turn things around?\u00a0I believe it isn\u2019t, but Boeing must immediately change its strategy from passive and closed to active and open.\u00a0Rather than wait for lawmakers or investigators to get to the bottom of things, which could be devastating for Boeing, the airplane manufacturer should collect all the relevant information and disclose as much as possible, however damaging.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nAn aerial photo shows several Boeing 737 MAX airplanes grounded at Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington, U.S. March 21, 2019.  REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson\n                            \n\n                    \n                Boeing should be able to answer questions like what happened, who is responsible and why did it happen. The best way to demonstrate its commitment to safety is not with platitudes but concrete actions that reveal openness and accountability. Research has shown that transparency and honesty are key to effective communication in a crisis.Ultimately, the company needs to show that the lives of passengers on its planes are more important than profits or its reputation. And in the long run, doing so will help it recover and regain trust that\u2019s been lost.We all expect airplanes to be safe. Boeing has violated that expectation.The decision about whether and when the 737 Max is back in the air \u2013 and how much this will ultimately cost Boeing \u2013 will be made by airlines, regulators and legislators. And, in turn, they will listen to their customers and constituents.If the court of public opinion finds Boeing guilty of putting their lives and their families\u2019 lives at risk, those decision-makers will find it hard to support the company.Kelli Matthews is senior instructor of journalism and communication at the University of Oregon.

At the same time, a perceived foreign policy victory would be a welcome distraction from a litany of domestic challenges. \u00a0Trump will have to come out of Hanoi being perceived as having prodded Kim closer to denuclearisation without having yielded too much in incentives. Here are a few steps he can take toward that objective.READ:\u00a0North Korea in 2018, a year of turning over a new leaf or worldwide gullibility? A commentaryPUSH FOR NORTH KOREA TO PROVIDE A LIST OF ALL THEIR NUKES\n    AdvertisementAfter the last summit, Trump\u00a0declared\u00a0that North Korea was no longer a nuclear threat. In fact, Pyongyang still possesses at least as much nuclear material now as before that meeting, and still has not provided a roadmap or timetable for getting rid of any of it.\u00a0This week,\u00a0Stanford University released\u00a0research\u00a0indicating that they have continued to produce\u00a0plutonium and enriched uranium.\u00a0North Korea has still not even clearly spelled out how many weapons of mass destruction they possess, the specifications of those weapons, where they are stored and other relevant details.\u00a0In an ostensible illustration of its commitment to denuclearisation, North Korea did last year dismantle a testing facility, but has not explained the status of the weapons they have on hand.Before agreeing to reward North Korea in any way, Trump should insist on that kind of disclosure. \u00a0If the US asks the North to make clear just how many nuclear weapons they have, and the North refuses, that will be a strong indication that the North Koreans are not negotiating in good faith, and have no real intention to denuclearise. And if the talks end with no significant progress, Trump will be able to credibly point to that refusal as an explanation for the lack of results.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nNorth Korea's nuclear test center was completely dismantled in accordance with the decision of the 3rd Plenary Meeting of the 7th General Conference of the Workers' Party of Korea in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency.

(Photo: AFP/STR)\n                            \n\n                    \n                It might be impossible for the two sides to fully agree on what complete denuclearisation really means, but at the Hanoi summit at least, Trump ought to make clear that a total withdrawal of US troops from South Korea is not on the table, and that if North Korea wants any of the \u201ccorresponding measures\u201d it has been talking about, some steps toward denuclearising, such as the disclosure of weapons mentioned above, must come first.PUT FORTH A POSSIBLE FRAMEWORK FOR FUTURE, LOWER-LEVEL DIALOGUESummits get the attention, but the real work of diplomacy takes place behind closed doors.Stephen Biegun, the US\u2019s top diplomat assigned to North Korea negotiations, recently travelled to the North Korean capital where he held meetings to prepare for the summit in Hanoi. After leaving North Korea, he said that \u201chard work\u201d was still needed before the summit.That was a polite way of saying that the two sides are still far from reaching an agreement.Despite the pressure to reach a breakthrough in Hanoi, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect any monumental result. Trump should therefore suggest the establishment of a regular schedule of meetings between diplomats from the two sides.READ:\u00a0Denuclearising North Korea won't make it a normal country, a commentaryAt those meetings, negotiators would be able to tackle the real questions of denuclearisation away from the glare of the spotlight.

In the United States, the debate has focused on identity, race and economic disparities. In Germany, it has centered on identity, religion (sometimes used as a cover for race) and loss of state control.Yet both countries are witnessing internal struggles in response to globalisation: Is it a reality to be accepted given the benefits of free trade and greater mobility, or a danger to be resisted given its importation of \u201cthe other\u201d and threat to state sovereignty?In grappling with this question, Germany should recall how an initially small movement in the US fundamentally altered the conversation.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementA NEW PARTY, A POWER STRUGGLEThe Alternative for Germany (AfD) party emerged in 2012 during the European financial crisis. Its founders, primarily drawn from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party led by Chancellor Angela Merkel, were centre-right conservatives and soft eurosceptics.They disliked Merkel\u2019s shift toward the political centre and decision to use German taxpayer money to bail out other eurozone members.The AfD narrowly failed to win seats in the 2013 national elections, but it found a new voice in 2015 amid the arrival of a million refugees and migrants. That summer, a power struggle within the party pitched the founders who focused on economic policy against a faction advocating a hardline, nationalist approach. The latter won.\n    AdvertisementThe AfD\u2019s new leadership adopted a more populist and xenophobic tone that prioritised immigration, domestic security and challenges to national sovereignty from European integration and refugees.In the Sep 24 elections, the AfD attracted nearly 6 million votes (12.6 per cent) and entered parliament for the first time as the third largest party.It didn\u2019t appeal simply to a right-wing fringe. It received support across party lines: A million votes from the Chancellor\u2019s CDU; 500,000 votes from the Social Democrats; and 400,000 from supporters of the post-communist Left Party. In addition, 1.2 million votes came from those who stayed home in past elections.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nAlexander Gauland, leader of the parliamentary group of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, is among those who now has a seat in the Bundestag. (File photo: AFP/Bernd von Jutrczenka)\n                            \n\n                    \n                The AfD responded to voters\u2019 anxiety about the refugee crisis by blaming it on state failure and fuelling anti-Muslim sentiment. Its leader vowed to \u201ctake back our country and our people,\u201d as the party scorned the political establishment and political correctness.TEA PARTYThe trajectory of the AfD bears similarities to the Tea Party movement in the United States. Both were born from centre-right frustration with perceived misuse of taxpayer money.The Tea Party emerged from conservative anger over increasing debt and federal spending. In particular, its adherents opposed auto industry and financial sector bailouts that begun during the Bush administration followed by a stimulus package and health care reform enacted by a Democrat-controlled Congress and White House.As with the AfD\u2019s shift from economics to immigration, the Tea Party\u2019s initial focus on financial issues was co-opted by advocates of conservative social policies.The Tea Party elevated the profile of individuals and issues previously consigned to the right-wing fringe. Its first targets were incumbent Republicans seen as too liberal.The movement gained power in the 2010 mid-term elections, when Republicans swept Democrats from the House of Representatives and Tea Party-endorsed politicians took office. Their activism left Speaker John Boehner unable to pass traditionally Republican-backed legislation and limited his ability to reach compromise with Democrats.There is a similar risk the AfD could shift political discourse to the right and force mainstream parties to adopt harder line positions, especially on Europe and immigration.In addition, the party\u2019s less extreme members could leave, as already seen with one leader\u2019s decision to serve as an independent, and be replaced by more radical advocates.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nFrauke Petry, the former co-leader of German far-right AfD, quit the party in October. She had said that\u00a0the party had become too \"anarchical\" and \"could not offer a credible platform\". (File photo: AFP/John Macdougall)\n                            \n\n                    \n                There are limits to this comparison. The AfD began as an elite-driven political party, while the Tea Party was a grassroots movement that benefited from wealthy donors and right-wing media support. The AfD, which is politically inexperienced and lacks internal discipline, remains a small opposition party in a parliamentary system.While the values undergirding the Tea Party gained voice in the White House with Donald Trump\u2019s election, the movement is not the sole factor for his success.And yet it would be a mistake to under-estimate the influence of populist voices in national discourse and the reasons for their broad-based appeal. While German sympathy for America\u2019s internal divisions is appreciated, the reality is that the two countries are facing similar trials.The main difference is the US has a year-long head start on working through the stages of grief, with many hovering between anger, bargaining, and depression depending on the day.But both are far from acceptance.Amanda Sloat is Robert Bosch senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Centre on the United States and Europe.

But the manner in which this potentially disastrous state has been reached also has sobering lessons for an international political order in which catastrophic climatic events are more frequent and long-term planning less so.Government officials, scientists and politicians, especially in the more arid southern hemisphere, are watching intently, aware that one of their own major cities might be next.It is a measure of the levels of anxiety, as well as a lack of confidence in the capacity of state structures to cope, that even the politicians seem to be relying on a miracle.Last November a popular cowboy-hatted lay preacher, Angus Buchan, was invited to lead a pray-for-rain gathering in this nominally secular country's parliament. Buchan, who arrived fresh, he claimed, from raising a woman from the dead, reassured his anxious congregants that the dams would be full by March 2018.\n    Advertisement\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nIn May last year, Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille led an inter-faith gathering on Table Mountain to pray for rain AFP/RODGER BOSCH\n                            \n\n                    \n                Whatever the timing, it promises to be a cliffhanger. Cape Town\u2019s winter rainy season runs from May to August.\u2018DAY ZERO\u2019Experts initially calculated \u201cDay Zero,\u201d the date upon which there is insufficient water in the Western Cape Water Supply System to push through the pipes to the suburbs and sprawling informal settlements that encircle the city, to be around Apr 16. It has since been pushed back to mid-May.With domestic consumption accounting for the bulk of water usage, officials are hoping their latest desperate cuts can stave off Day Zero until the rains begin.Agriculture, especially the wine estates that along with the scenic splendour of the region are a major draw for the 1.5 million foreigners who visited the city last year, uses about a third of the water.Irrigation usage has declined over the past five years, although there have been criticisms of the national Department of Water and Sanitation for not cutting the agricultural allocation when the prospects of an extended drought became more apparent. Instead, they increased it.It is this kind of blundering that lies at the nub of the unfolding natural disaster. For Day Zero is not primarily driven by climatic change, although climatologists agree that phenomenon plays an as yet scientifically undetermined role.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nDesiccated tree trunks protrude from the floor of Theewaterskloof Dam, a major water supply for Cape Town. The city is grappling with its worst drought in a century. (Photo:\u00a0AFP/Rodger BOSCH)\n                            \n\n                    \n                \u201cSimply blaming climate change is a cop-out,\u201d says Professor Graham Jewitt, the Umgeni Water Chair of Water Resources Management at the University of KwaZulu-Natal and director of its Centre for Water Resources Research.\u00a0He added:It has become\u00a0just another scapegoat for the blame game of the politicians.THE POLITICS OF WATERThe core problem is that the city of Cape Town and its home province, the Western Cape, are governed by the liberal Democratic Alliance. That makes the Western Cape the only provincial government not run by the ruling African National Congress (ANC), which has dominated national politics since winning the country\u2019s first post-apartheid elections in 1994.Many ANC politicians would love to see the liberal ruling Democratic Alliance tarnished by failure in the Cape, perhaps opening the way to the ANC recapturing the province in 2019.Internationally, this translates into a stifling lack of pragmatism. The South African government, which is strongly aligned with the Palestinian cause, has snubbed informal offers of help made by the Israeli ambassador.Israel has substantial expertise in desalination technology, but last year the mere presence of a former Israeli ambassador on a panel to discuss water management aroused such protest that the event was cancelled.Within the country, accusations and insults have been flowing thick and fast between the local, provincial and national tiers of government, each with its own legislatively determined role in the water procurement process.The national Department of Water and Sanitation has blamed the local and provincial governments for not reacting vigorously enough when it became apparent, years ago, that densification was going to strain water supplies. The city\u2019s population has increased by 50 per cent in the last decade.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nIf the rains do not materialise and consumption does not fall in Cape Town, people will be forced to use standpipes, officials say. (Photo: AFP/Rodger Bosch)\n                            \n\n                    \n                They, in turn, have accused the national government of dragging its feet on capital funding for infrastructure and maintenance, as well as withholding emergency disaster relief funds.DYSFUNCTION AT THE NATIONAL LEVELWhile it is true that all the parties have made blunders, city officials probably shouldn\u2019t be blamed for lack of long-term planning. Cape dams were overflowing as recently as 2014; the statistical chance of a three-year drought was said to be 0.1 percent.Given those odds, local authorities did not want to take the political risk of diverting funds sorely needed for social development.But happen the drought did, and it has exposed the operational dysfunction in the national ministry. Just six weeks ago the Department of Water and Sanitation released its draft national water master plan for comment.Driven by what it calls a \u201csense of urgency,\u201d it admits that \u201cthe current water crisis serves as a stark reminder of the impact of delayed action\u201d in the augmentation of the Western Cape Water Supply.Belated attempts are now being made to bring aquifer water to the surface, as well as an emergency desalination plant. In the long term, most crucially, residents have to get used to using water more sparingly, says Jewitt.The immediate catastrophe of Day Zero can still be averted. With the direct intervention last week of Zuma\u2019s likely successor Deputy-President Cyril Ramaphosa and Western Cape Premier Helen Zille, the muddled responses of competing bureaucracies are at last being pulled together.At the most basic level, cutting consumption to the new 50-litre maximum could move Day Zero along the calendar into the traditional winter rainy season.Of course, whether precipitation then actually materialises is anyone\u2019s guess.William Saunderson-Meyer is a South African journalist and writes the nationally-syndicated Jaundiced Eye column."},

Republicans and Democrats alike have supported a global network of American-led alliances and security guarantees.Leading figures in both parties \u2014 from John Kennedy to Ronald Reagan through to the Bushes and Clintons \u2014 agreed that it was in US interests to promote free-trade and democracy around the world.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementDonald Trump has taken an axe to this Washington consensus. The US president\u2019s departure from the established principles of American foreign policy is so radical that many of his critics dismiss his ideas as simply the product of a disordered mind.But that is a mistake. There is an emerging Trump doctrine that makes internal sense. There are four broad principles underpinning this approach.1. ECONOMICS FIRSTFrom his inaugural address, in which he decried the \u201ccarnage\u201d and \u201crusted-out factories\u201d of the US Midwest, Mr Trump has defined making America \u201cgreat again\u201d in economic terms. To this end, he has focused on countries that he believes have excessive trade surpluses with the US.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementThis emphasis on trade and economics blurs the distinction between allies and adversaries \u2014 many of the nations that have a large trade surplus with America are also important security partners including Japan and Germany.\u00a0That is why Mr Trump described the EU as a foe this week. His economics-first viewpoint leads him to question the value of the US\u2019s traditional security alliances, since he sees these as essentially a subsidy to economic adversaries.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nTrump flew in to Britain on Thursday, having already subjected NATO allies to a roasting over their levels of defence spending AFP/Pablo Martinez Monsivais\n                            \n\n                    \n                2. NATIONS NOT INSTITUTIONS\n    AdvertisementMost previous US presidents have expressed frustration from time to time with international institutions, such as the UN, the World Trade Organisation and the G7.But Mr Trump has raised these objections to another level. He regards international institutions as bastions of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d on issues such as climate change.\u00a0He would much prefer to deal with other nations on a one-to-one basis, where America\u2019s size advantage can be made to tell.\u00a0Multilateral institutions, where the US can be out-voted, are best avoided. The \u201crules-based international order\u201d, carefully nurtured by previous presidents, is being deliberately undermined by the Trump administration.3. CULTURE NOT VALUESAll postwar American presidents, even the ultra-realist Richard Nixon, have believed that their role was to uphold certain universal values. It has been easy for US critics to point out inconsistencies, and occasional hypocrisy, in America\u2019s promotion of democracy and human rights. But the rhetorical commitment was a central part of the US approach.Mr Trump, by contrast, has shown very little interest in democracy promotion or human rights. His conception of the west is based not on shared values, but on culture or, even, race.\u00a0This leads to his preoccupation with controlling immigration, which he believes is the real threat to the west. He reiterated this view on his current trip to Europe, arguing that immigration is \u201cvery bad for Europe, it\u2019s changing the culture\u201d.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump holds a news conference after participating in the NATO Summit in Brussels, Belgium July 12, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman\n                            \n\n                    \n                4. SPHERES OF INTERESTMr Trump is not a believer in universal values and rules. So it is much easier for him to accept the idea that the world could (or should) be divided up into informal \u201cspheres of influence\u201d in which great powers such as the US, Russia and China dominate their respective regions.\u00a0The US president has never explicitly endorsed this idea. But he has hinted at it, in his suggestion that Crimea is naturally part of Russia \u2014 and in his frequent questioning of the value of America\u2019s global alliances.Mr Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for dealing with strongman leaders, such as Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia, may also incline him to try to settle disputes in the manner of a chief executive who divides up a market with a rival company. The question of what values the Chinese or Russians are attempting to spread in their regions is not of interest to Mr Trump.The US foreign-policy establishment is understandably appalled by this radical departure from hallowed principles that have been upheld for decades. But there is a case for taking a fresh look at a foreign policy that was forged after 1945, under very different circumstances. Back then the Cold War was raging and American economic supremacy was unquestioned.The problem is that Mr Trump\u2019s policies are not just radical. They are also dangerous and morally suspect.\u00a0America needs allies. Undermining the US-led alliance system and promoting \u201cspheres of influence\u201d encourages the expansion of Chinese and Russian influence.Even if the Trump administration\u2019s only concern is US economic interests, that is not a good idea. Previous generations of US policymakers understood that security and economic concerns are closely entwined \u2014 not antithetical. Mr Trump also has a very simplistic view of US economic interests, in which the only thing that seems to matter is a trade surplus.And finally, there is the moral aspect. Many people will mourn the passing of an America that aspired to be a force for good. During the Cold War and its aftermath, it mattered that the world\u2019s dominant power was a country that believed in promoting political and economic freedom.\u00a0The whole world will pay a price, if that is no longer true.\u00a9 2018 The Financial Times Ltd.

And, as with financial crises, it is always better to prevent a crisis than to confront one, because the latter entails huge economic, social, and political costs.Ex post measures aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19, such as quarantines and travel bans, don\u2019t seem to work in our age of mobility and economic integration.After the United States government announced at the end of January that it would temporarily refuse entry to foreign nationals who had recently travelled within China, Italy\u2019s government banned direct flights to and from China.But this measure \u2013 adopted in response to pressure from the populist right-wing League party \u2013 will create tensions with China, a major trading partner that buys about US$16 billion worth of Italian exports each year. Nor does the flight ban solve the problem of monitoring indirect arrivals to Italy from China.DIFFERENT RESPONSES REQUIREDThe ban may rebound on Italy in other ways, too. Its European neighbours, for example, may be tempted to impose entry bans on Italians in order to appease popular anxiety and anti-foreign sentiment.Already, the French far-right leader Marine Le Pen has urged France\u2019s government to suspend the Schengen Agreement and introduce border controls with Italy. And earlier in February, the Austrian authorities briefly blocked trains entering the country from Italy.READ:\u00a0Commentary: COVID-19 may be a mild illness for most peopleEpidemics affect different countries in different ways, and national policymakers must tailor their responses accordingly.At the same time, governments should coordinate measures aimed at protecting health-care workers and vulnerable individuals and countries. The lesson from Italy so far is that a lack of coordination among local governments, coupled with political fragmentation, puts all containment measures at risk by encouraging more people to leave the worst-affected areas.Many university students, for example, have already returned home from Northern Italy. So, containment measures in one place may succeed only in shifting the problem elsewhere.POISONONOUS POLITICAL CLIMATEThe current expectation is that the COVID-19 virus will continue to spread within Italy and throughout the rest of Europe. Although the numbers remain tiny \u2013 there currently are only 41 confirmed cases in France, for example \u2013 the panic level is high enough to open the door to potentially restrictive measures.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nMass closures of Italian public institutions and businesses due to the coronavirus are affecting the lives of millions AFP/Miguel MEDINA\n                            \n\n                    \n                Given today\u2019s poisonous political climate, can we be sure that governments will not introduce measures that override existing legislation and restrict individual rights and freedoms?Might people infected with the COVID-19 virus lose their right to health treatment when abroad, for example? Or might they be prevented from returning to their own country, as US President Donald Trump announced would be the case for infected Americans overseas?READ:\u00a0Commentary: Three struggles South Korea faces in arresting COVID-19 outbreakIn that respect, the COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted the absence of an international legal framework to deal with pandemics.Meanwhile, the outbreak will have a significant impact on the Italian economy, and likely tip it into recession. Northern Italy is the country\u2019s economic engine, with per capita GDP of approximately \u20ac35,000 (US$38,000) \u2013 compared to the national figure of \u20ac28,000 \u2013 and a 67 per cent employment rate, against 59 per cent nationwide.But major trade events such as the Milan Furniture Fair have been cancelled or postponed, business trips have been scrapped, and uncertainty is rife. Furthermore, virus-related cancellations are already hitting the country\u2019s tourism industry, which accounts for 14 per cent of GDP.Having long been saddled with a sluggish economy \u2013 real GDP grew by just 0.2 per cent in 2019 \u2013 Italy is now faced with a recession.

It was accused of exaggerating the threat, and WHO officials fear that the word \u2018pandemic\u2019 would lead to panic.This stands in contrast to the response of US and Australian authorities. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spokesperson Benjamin Haynes said on Feb 26 that the novel coronavirus has already met two of the three criteria for a pandemic, and the world was moving closer to meeting the third criteria.The CDC has said that a coronavirus outbreak in the United States is a matter of when, not if. In doing so, US health authorities have essentially contradicted the claims of US President Donald Trump that \u201cbecause of all we\u2019ve done, the risk to the American people remains very low\u201d.READ:\u00a0Commentary: Why Japan\u2019s move to close schools during COVID-19 outbreak upset many \u2013 and not just parentsREAD:\u00a0Commentary: COVID-19 is now coming for Italy and EuropeThe Australian government has activated its pandemic emergency plan, as new cases were reported over the weekend in countries as widespread as Azerbaijan, Ecuador, and Ireland.COUNTRIES COULD RESPOND BETTERIt\u2019s worth noting that a pandemic declaration did not happen during the SARS outbreak. A pandemic is often declared after efforts to contain an outbreak in specific regions or countries fail.\u00a0The idea is that such a declaration will prompt governments to switch from containment measures (quarantining individual cases) to mitigation (shutting schools and other mass gatherings to slow the spread).\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nVietnamese students of Hanoi National University of Education, wearing protective masks, attend the first day of classes after returning to the university, which was closed for over a month in, Hanoi, Vietnam on Mar\u00a02, 2020.

The shock to the global economy now looks like it is going to last much longer and be potentially far deeper than was thought just a few weeks ago.The hope that the economic hit might be painful but short-lived looks increasingly unrealistic.

Suddenly, the North Korean tanks invaded us, and what we had then was a 81mm mortar, not enough to go up against the North Korean tanks,\u201d recalled Mr Park, 91, a retired lieutenant colonel today, speaking to the programme Insight. (Watch the episode here)Korea had been divided into two spheres of influence after World War Two, which had ended just five years prior. The Americans controlled the South while the Soviet Union installed a communist regime in the North.This 38th parallel line left a deep division between the two halves, with each claiming to be the legitimate government of all Korea.ONLY THREE DAYS TO TAKE SEOUL \n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementIn 1950, North Korean forces launched an attack across the 38th parallel and quickly took most of the territories in the South.For us, it felt like burglars suddenly broke into our homes.\u201cThat was why our preparation for the war was insufficient and we were not able to fend off the North Koreans,\u201d Mr Park said.They were forced to use delaying tactics to slow down the North Korea military as far as possible, including building a defence force at the south of the Han River. However, it only took three days for the invading army to overrun South Korea\u2019s capital Seoul.\n    Advertisement\u201cNo words can describe how I felt. Seoul being defeated was not something that we could have imagined. It happened so suddenly,\u201d he said. \u201cMany South Korean soldiers died and many were wounded.\u201dWhen the 38th parallel was established, the division was arbitrary and had no basis in history, pointed out Mr John Delury, associate professor of East Asian studies at Yonsei University in Seoul.With the invasion, North Korea had wanted to reunify the Korean peninsula.\u201cThe South actually wouldn\u2019t have minded invading the North,\u201d said Mr Delury. \u201cIn the end, it was the North that decided they had the opportunity.\u00a0\"They thought they had the military advantage so Kim Il Sung,\u00a0with the support of the Soviet Union and of communist China, decided to invade. And that led to horrific consequences for everyone involved.\u201dThe United States then was not ready to fight as it had demilitarised after WWII; It had just a small number of forces in South Korea, said Mr Thomas Byrne, president of the New York-based Korea Society. And none of the soldiers had combat experience.\u201cKorea had also been excluded from the perimeter of defence that the US would consider to be within its strategic interests in East Asia,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that probably encouraged the North Korea leader Kim Il Sung and Joseph Stalin (leader of the Soviet Union) to give the green light to the invasion.\u201dTHE NORTH\u2019S SIEGE MENTALITY The United Nations (UN) then backed what it called a \"police action\" to repulse the advance of North Korean forces \u2013 some 21 countries eventually entered the conflict with the US providing 88 per cent of the UN Forces.Former US President Mr Harry Truman said then: \u201cIf aggression is successful in Korea, we can expect it to spread in Asia, Europe and this hemisphere. We are fighting in Korea for our own national security and survival.\u201dThe allied forces launched an amphibious invasion in 1950 - the Battle of Inchon that resulted in a decisive victory and strategic reversal in favour of the UN. \u00a0It led to the recapture of Seoul and the allied forces also managed to push back the North Korean invaders - all the way to the Northern border with China.\u201cThat completely turned the course of the war,\u201d said Mr Delury. \u201cThat was one of the great military strategic triumphs of modern history.\u201dThe US forces then attacked North Korea with one of the most devastating aerial bombings in history - dropping more than 600,000 tons of explosives on the country, including more than 30,000 tons of napalm. More bombs were dropped on North Korea than throughout the entire Pacific theatre during WWII.\u201cThey were carpet-bombed to no end. There are US military documents complaining that there were no targets left, there's nothing to hit,\u201d said Mr Delury.So it created the kind of siege mentality that you still see is a part of the North Korean psyche to this day,STALEMATE AND ARMISTICE In October 1950, China entered the Korean conflict and with its troops, pushed the US and UN forces back to the 38th parallel.There was a two-year stalemate with bloody battles but not very much changes in territory, said Mr Bruce Klingner, an Asia expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank.\u201cSo that\u2019s why you can say everyone lost, no one won - just horrific bloodshed,\u201d he added.An armistice was subsequently signed in 1953 which froze the forces in place.\u201cThe two sides kind of lost their will to keep slugging it out. It was pretty clear no one was going to win militarily and so, they signed an armistice agreement,\u201d said Mr Delury, adding that it was supposed to be a prelude to a peace treaty.That treaty never happened, he added. \u201cAnd so Korea has lived with this very temporary armistice system for about 70 years.So that\u2019s how the Korean War sort of ended - it both ended and it didn\u2019t.By the time the armistice was signed in July 1953, 2.5 million people had died, and it is estimated that 20 per cent of the North Korean population perished.But until today, many North Koreans still believe that it was the US which provoked the war in 1950 as part of its broader strategy of the post-war global domination.Former North Korean military officer Choi Jung-Hoon, who defected to the South in 2006, said their history books showed that it was the South that attacked them first.\u201cWhen I came to South Korea, what shocked me the most was the history that I studied in North Korea was a complete lie, and that was the first time I knew about it,\u201d he said. The North Korean mindset was that \u201cthe US military had fought wars and killed many North Koreans\u201d.GOING NUCLEARThe end of the armed conflict, however, failed to bring an end to hostilities between the two countries - if anything, it put both nations technically and perpetually in a state of war.Many North Koreans still regard the US and South Koreans as the aggressors, and preventing another attack by the US therefore became the priority of the regime. This survival mentality was what prompted supreme leader Kim Il Sung to embark on an ambitious nuclear program to help ensure its long-term security.Mr Nah Liang Tuang, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, said the country was subjected to widespread devastation \u2013 Pyongyang had been completely levelled to the ground and had to be rebuilt from scratch.\u201cWhen you consider that North Korea was at that time assisted by hundreds and thousands of Chinese solders as well as support\u2026from the Soviet Union, while at the same time still suffering so much devastation \u2013 then the rationale for acquiring nuclear weapons as an independent deterrent to preserve national security becomes understandable from Kim Il Sung\u2019s standpoint,\u201d Mr Nah said.Mr Choi shared that the leaders were so hell-bent on developing their own nuclear weapons that they were willing to ignore the plight of their own people.Even though the North Korean people were starving to death, they will only focus on nuclear development.With the help of the Soviet Union, the North began to work on its nuclear complex, and in the early 1980s, it successfully built its first nuclear power plant in Yongbyon.Pyongyang insisted it was only for peaceful purposes, and even became a party to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1985, which barred the country from producing nuclear weapons.But when pressed for access to its nuclear waste sites, it started to become jittery and threatened to withdraw from the NPT. The country also began to reprocess fuel rods from its nuclear reactor \u2013 a process which would give it enough weapons-grade plutonium for five or six nuclear weapons.Former US president Bill Clinton later negotiated a peace deal with Pyongyang in 1994, where North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities in exchange for aid.THE END OF GOODWILLBut that goodwill ended when Mr George W Bush took over as US President in 2001 \u2013 he took a more hardline stance towards North Korea and even called the country, along with Iraq and Iran, part of an \u2018Axis of Evil\u2019.Pyongyang withdrew from the NPT and reactivated its nuclear power facilities - the agreed framework signed between the two countries simply collapsed.By 2005, North Korea declared that it had its own nuclear weapons, and a year later, it tested its first nuclear device - sending shockwaves through Asia and around the world.Mr Bush called for stiff UN sanctions on the regime, but it continued to defy numerous UN resolutions to halt its nuclear weapons and missile tests.When US President Barack Obama took over, he maintained a policy of strategic patience, but that failed to persuade Pyongyang to come to the negotiating table. If anything, the policy had allowed the country to further develop its nuclear and long-range missile capability.In 2016, they conducted their fifth underground nuclear test \u2013 its most powerful thermonuclear weapon.Less than six years into his reign, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has tested more missiles than his father and grandfather combined, and he also claimed that the missile could hit major cities in the US.\u201cThe deposit of strategic patience did not have sharp enough teeth,\u201d pointed out Mr Nah. \u201cStrategic patience was in effect fairly ineffectual because it was not backed up by effective sanctions.\u201dTHE TRUMP EFFECTThe rise of Mr Donald Trump as US President last year changed the dynamics in the region - the US policy of strategic patience was replaced by a tough foreign policy of engagement towards North Korea.Last October, the US sent a naval strike group led by aircraft carrier Carl Vinson to the Pacific as a show of force - a warning to them against conducting further nuclear tests.The Trump administration presents new opportunities for North Korea, said Mr Kim Hyun Wook, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy, and Mr Trump had never negotiated with North Korea before.He wanted a new kind of negotiation style of his own to be reflected in his talk with North Korea.\u201cSo I think the presidency change in the US might be harder on the two countries' relationship, but at the same time, it gives a new opportunity\u2026for the two,\u201d he said.But as both sides kept engaging in a dangerous game of political brinkmanship, the chain of threats and counter-threats between two erstwhile enemies brought the two nations closer to an armed conflict.From calling each other names to taunts about nuclear devices, Mr Trump and Mr Kim kept the world riveted with their war of words.Mr Choi believes that when push comes to shove, Mr Kim might use his missiles to protect himself and the regime.\u201cThe nuclear weapons were developed to keep the US in check. If Kim Jong Un gets pushed into a corner, he might fire those missiles,\u201d he said.\u201cThey claimed to have built an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) that flew 16,000km across the missile range. So if he gets cornered, he could use those nuclear missiles.\u201dOLIVE BRANCH TO THE SOUTH But in a surprise move, Pyongyang suddenly offered an olive branch to the South - it announced that it would send its athletes to compete in the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February this year.That led to an inter-Korean Summit between the two historic foes, culminating in the Panmunjom Declaration which reaffirmed the commitment of both leaders to work towards \u201ccomplete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula\u201d and bringing the Korean War to a full closure.This diplomatic gesture marked a significant shift in relations between the two Koreas, and also set the stage for a historic meeting between Mr Kim and Mr Trump.Pressure from the international community, the US and its hardline policy may also have made the North Korean people more disgruntled \u2013 making Mr Kim realise that these may put its regime in danger, said Mr Kim Hyun Wook.\u201cThere might have been some change of Kim Jong Un's perceptions that he is a different leader from his father and his grandfather,\u201d he said.He has experienced a Western society, educated in Switzerland\u2026maybe he wants to make North Korea a normal state like other countries.For North Korea, if it wants to improve the economy and standard of living, and to shift its strategic focus of building up its military to that of the economy \u2013 then it has to have unfettered access to international markets for trade and finance, said Mr Byrne.\u201cThe sanctions that exist\u2026have basically boxed in North Korea, and more severely cramped North Korea\u2019s ability to earn foreign exchange to trade, to develop its own economy,\u201d he said.Ms Kim Jiyoon, a senior fellow at the Seoul-based Asan Institute for Policy Studies, said that Mr Trump would be looking at a breakthrough too, especially with the midterm elections coming up in November and the presidential elections in 2020.\u201cHe\u2019s not really in a good situation domestically right now\u2026so he probably wants to have (a) really good deal for him to brag about,\u201d she added.POSITION OF STRENGTH But there\u2019s a growing realisation in the Trump\u2019s administration that a deal may not be reached in just one meeting.Said Mr Trump: \u201cIt'll be a beginning \u2026 I've never said it happens in one meeting, you're talking about years of hostility, years of problems. Years of really hatred between so many different nations.\u00a0 But I think you're going to have a very positive result in the end, (but) not from one meeting.\u201dMr Delury said that there\u2019s real political will between the two leaders for the summit to be a success, but the negotiation will be complex.\u201cIf Singapore doesn\u2019t happen, that probably means the parties are close enough. And so they are going to wait and try again,\u201d he added.That\u2019s also the dream of retired lieutenant colonel Mr Park - peace.He is constantly reminded of the pains of the Korean War \u2013 today, in his sunset years, he spends most of his time hanging out with his friends, many of whom are former soldiers, to share and relive old memories.After experiencing the bitter war in the 1950s, he does not wish to see the repeat of the painful episode ever again.War - he feels - should never be the solution to the ongoing problem facing the two divided nations, especially for South Koreans who have been living under a nuclear threat shadow for decades.\u201cShouldn't my children and my grandchildren not have to go through another war like this? If you have not fought a war, you won\u2019t understand. There should be no war. This is my only hope,\u201d he said.Watch this episode of Insight here. \u00a0"},

US policy needs clearer objectives, a more realistic approach, and better tactics to achieve its goals.\u00a0Today\u2019s reflexive, tit-for-tat tariff escalation is proving ineffective and may cause lasting damage to both economies and to the critical US-China geopolitical relationship.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementREAD:\u00a0The revival of a neo-conservative stand against China, a commentaryREAD: The great disconnect between China the 'developing country' and China the great power, a commentaryUS-CHINA TRADE ISSUESThe United States has inter-related problems with China and at different times has emphasised different issues, confusing Chinese negotiators.\u00a0\n    AdvertisementPresident Trump has made a big deal of the bilateral trade imbalance.\u00a0Economists do not see this as a problem.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n(Photo: AFP/Jim Watson)\n                            \n\n                    \n                China\u2019s overall current account surplus, the broadest measure of trade, is down to about 1 per cent of GDP in 2018. China has deficits with many countries that export natural resources and surpluses with some advanced economies, like the United States, that import its manufactured goods.\u00a0The administration could probably reach an agreement to sell more to China, especially agricultural and energy products. Other things being\u00a0equal, this would reduce China\u2019s bilateral surplus. But the United States would then likely sell less of those products to other countries so that those bilateral imbalances would worsen. Nothing real would have happened.A second and more important issue is that China has many market access restrictions. Some of these are old-fashioned protectionism: For many years, China had a 25 per cent tariff on auto imports. That has recently been reduced to 15 per cent, but such taxation is still high in today\u2019s world.\u00a0There are also many sectors in which China restricts direct foreign investment, usually by requiring foreign firms to be minority partners in joint ventures.\u00a0Here, China is out of step with practices in other large emerging markets such as Brazil, India\u00a0and South Africa. This investment protectionism puts foreign firms at a disadvantage and results in their transferring technology to Chinese state enterprises that will eventually be their competitors.\u00a0But China is now showing willingness to reduce restrictions in autos and financial services. This is a good start and a promising area in which Washington could make real progress in negotiations.READ:\u00a0Despite headwinds, China continues to open up, a commentaryTHE TECHNOLOGY COMPETITIONA third issue closely related to the second is technology competition between these two biggest economies in the world.\u00a0These two spend the most, globally, on research and development, and there will naturally be competition to develop the technologies of the future. As long as it is on a level playing field, such competition is healthy. Each is likely to make breakthroughs.\u00a0The innovators will capture some of the benefits, but the nature of technology diffusion is that much of the benefit will spread to the whole world.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nChinese President Xi Jinping, centre, talks with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, right, as Lu Wei, left, China's Internet czar, looks on at Microsoft's main campus in 2015 (Photo: AFP/TED S. WARREN)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Yet China distorts this competition in multiple ways. Chinese firms operating behind protective barriers often gain extra resources to take their innovations out to the world.\u00a0China\u2019s industrial plan, \u201cMade in China 2025,\u201d sets targets for domestic self-sufficiency in key industries, and some tools to achieve these goals will violate market-oriented rules.\u00a0READ: The trouble with 'Made in China', a commentaryDirect subsidies to innovators and to state-owned enterprises also tilt the playing field toward China\u2019s technologically sophisticated companies.\u00a0Weak international property rights protection in China, especially for foreign firms, puts US\u00a0technologies at risk.\u00a0Finally, as suggested by recent reports, China still condones cyber theft of commercial secrets.\u00a0Pushback against these policies is needed, but it would be far more effective if mounted by a global coalition of the United States and its allies.More difficult issues arise for technologies that have defence applications. Each side has trade and investment restrictions concerning defence-related technologies.\u00a0The key issue here is to identify and update the areas that need to be restricted for legitimate security reasons.\u00a0At the same time, these restrictions must not be allowed to become excuses for protectionism.To address these multiple concerns, some voices in Washington are calling for the United States to disengage from China. They argue that it will not be possible to have fair competition and that the two countries are likely to be in conflict in the future.\u00a0This is a dangerous idea.\u00a0First, US\u00a0allies are not going to follow\u00a0if the US\u00a0adopts a Cold War policy of trying to contain China.\u00a0Second, an isolated China will have even stronger incentives to adopt unfair practices to achieve economic and technological parity. It is better to manage the competition than to assume that it is headed for conflict.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe US imported around US$500 billion worth of products from China last year, compared to US$130 billion in US goods imported by the Asian country (Photo: AFP/STR)\n                            \n\n                    \n                THE TRADE WAR IS\u00a0A TACTICThe rapid, wide-ranging escalation of tariffs in the US-China trade war has no precedent in the years since the Great Depression. The war began in early 2018 with US tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, and has now escalated to covering US$250 billion of US imports from China.\u00a0China, in turn, has imposed tariffs on the bulk of its imports from the United States. These actions \u2014 mostly unilateral and pointedly discriminatory \u2014 are almost certainly inconsistent with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.The tariffs applied by the two countries are not \u201cremedies\u201d in the sense of correcting market distortions, nor are they preventing, say, sharp adjustments in a declining industry.\u00a0On the contrary, they will cause dislocations, raise costs, and increase uncertainty. Their value lies in the possibility that they will force the other side to make concessions, or at least deter it from even worse behaviour.\u00a0READ:\u00a0Why tariffs are the wrong instruments to address US-China trade issues, a commentaryIf that doesn\u2019t happen \u2014 if neither side capitulates to the other\u2019s demands \u2014 the tariffs will prove to be costly, mutual mistakes.And that seems to be where the US-China trade war is headed.\u00a0These are large, domestically oriented economies that depend lightly on each other\u2019s markets, so punitive tariffs have limited macroeconomic effects.\u00a0The value added in China\u2019s exports to the United States amounts to about 2 per cent of the country\u2019s GDP, down significantly from just a decade ago.\u00a0United States exports to China amount to only about 1 per cent of GDP. In the short run, these tariffs will subtract only a small amount from each economy\u2019s growth. Capitulation on either side is very unlikely.Over time, the costs of these tariffs will grow. The United States is apparently confident in threatening China because US\u00a0imports from China exceed US\u00a0exports to China.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe trade war between the US and China deepened when President Donald Trump announced he would push ahead with tariffs on US$200 billion in Chinese goods. (File photo:\u00a0AFP/Paul J. RICHARDS)\n                            \n\n                    \n                But the asymmetry is illusory; tensions are already spilling into areas where the two countries are both consequential, including relations on the Korean Peninsula and between the Chinese and US\u00a0militaries in the Western Pacific.\u00a0In these new spheres the potential for mutual damage is still higher.Meanwhile, rapid-fire retaliations have all but closed off meaningful negotiations. The real issues, noted above, are complex and cannot be resolved by tweaking a ready template, such as existing trade agreements in the case of the South Korea-US free trade deal (KORUS) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\u00a0In mid-September, Chinese and US\u00a0officials apparently agreed to efforts to launch negotiations, but were then undermined by President Trump. With capitulation as the only option, Chinese decision makers halted discussions.SEEKING BETTER RESULTSThe self-defeating cycle of tit-for-tar tariff escalation is in neither country\u2019s interest.\u00a0Even if the US\u00a0goal were to disengage \u2014 an objective that we think would be wrong \u2014that could be accomplished firmly and with fewer side effects with widely based tariffs and prohibitions on specific trade and investment flows.\u00a0And if the United States does intend to solve genuine problems, it can suspend punitive tariffs while negotiations make progress.\u00a0Current tariffs are hardening positions rather than producing meaningful effects. They are taxes that make American producers less competitive and ultimately fall on consumers; they are bound to become unpopular over time.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nChina-US relations have taken a hefty knock from tit-for-tat tariffs. (Photo: AFP/Daisuke Suzuki)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Avoiding ineffective tariff escalation is not capitulation but smart policy, the first step toward achieving the goal of disengagement or negotiation.\u00a0An end to tit-for-tat responses \u2014 what the Hudson Institute\u2019s Herman Kahn described in 1965, for nuclear war, as the \u201corgiastic spasm of destruction in which all the buttons are pressed and the commanding officers go home\u201d \u2014 will offer immediate economic benefits to both sides and improve the climate for negotiation.Stopping tit-for-tat escalation is beneficial even for a single country. The value of avoiding an \u201cown goal\u201d \u2013 imposing costs on the home economy \u2014 is self-evident.\u00a0In addition, there may well will be advantages for China from some steps advocated by the United States, but it is hard to pursue these ideas in the trade war environment.\u00a0The trade war plays into the hands of those who want to bolster state enterprises and maintain protectionism.\u00a0By putting tit-for-tat policies in the rearview mirror, China can focus on long-term priorities. These may include policies that have little to do with the United States, including the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Belt and Road Initiative, as well as opening sectors to improve China\u2019s competitiveness.\u00a0Along these lines, China recently cut tariffs on more than 1,500 products and eased investment restrictions to signal its continued economic opening.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nChina's footprint abroad is growing with its Belt and Road Initiative, with US$1 trillion in investments across Asia and Europe. (Photo:\u00a0AFP/Nicolas Asfouri)\u00a0\n                            \n\n                    \n                Fruitful agreements between China and United States, however dim they may appear today, are possible. Many in China recognise that recent trends toward centralisation have backfired, and that continued growth will depend on renewed \u201copening up\u201d in sectors ranging from financial services to technology.\u00a0China can take numerous unilateral steps that will benefit its domestic economy and be welcomed by Americans.Within reasonable limits, the world\u2019s first and second largest economies cannot disengage fully, regardless of the actions of particular administrations. They will compete in many areas and remain complementary in others.\u00a0The success of each will depend far more on its own policies than the policies of the other. Their joint goal must be to eliminate irritants, reduce distrust, and wall off areas of rivalry from those that allow mutually beneficial collaboration.\u00a0Even though neither China nor the United States is currently a party to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that agreement establishes guidelines for competition in areas such as internet openness, data mobility, intellectual property protection, open investment, and the neutrality of state-owned enterprises.\u00a0These issues will have to be addressed sooner or later, whether now or under future administrations.David Dollar is a senior fellow in the John L\u00a0Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution.

America is the obvious example, but Britain, France and Italy are topical too.Perhaps size fosters a sense of entitlement to control. Globalism is the opposite of control. For small countries, which are much more used to being done to and acted upon, there is nothing more banal than powerlessness in the face of the external.Globalism is just another visitation from history. The reaction against it is accordingly muted. If small countries have mastered the global age, it is a feat that goes beyond the economic.\u00a0They also have a cultural reach that was hard to picture not long ago, when nations needed the brawn of a BBC or a Canal Plus to foist their creative wares on distant audiences.Scandinavian noir, The Luminaries, Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s mesmeric hold on the anglophone reader, even the setting of a film as big as Crazy Rich Asians on an island that has to eke out land from the straits: All attest to what we are now obliged to call the \u201csoft power\u201d of small countries.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\"Crazy Rich Asians,\" the Warner Bros. adaptation of Kevin Kwan's best-selling novel of the same name, took $25 million AFP/Alberto E.

For those who live in or care about these places, the dread is that the coming decades will be as harsh as the last few have been kind.Almost all the conditions that allowed small nations to bloom look precarious. There is a protectionist fad that should haunt these trade-dependent economies like nothing else.Nation-blind rules are giving way to the newly assertive colossi of America, China, Russia and India. The most successful minnows have always counted on the patronage of larger forces: an EU financial backstop, say, or the US security umbrella.An unrolling of this noblesse oblige would leave them exposed in a world where nimbleness begins to matter less than raw heft.READ:\u00a0Are Trump\u2019s foreign policy moves setting the stage for global chaos?

This includes the unelected bureaucrats who do things such as handle threats to public health.Competence means following the science. Mr Trump has given the role of coronavirus tsar to Mike Pence, the US vice-president.Mr Pence has wrestled with scientific doubts all his life.

Now that he needs them, we may be about to find out whether he meant it.TILT AWAY FROM GLOBALISATIONThe second blow is to America\u2019s openness. Mr Trump has long railed against globalism.

Joe Biden and Michael Bloomberg have stuck to a more conventional script.But the spirit of the times is running against them.

The European Union is winning plaudits from green activists for aiming to be \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d by 2050.Cities from Adelaide to Boston to Rio de Janeiro are announcing similar goals, with Copenhagen saying it will get there already in 2025.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementBE SCEPTICALSuch promises should be greeted with a healthy dose of scepticism. Copenhagen, for example, will likely miss its target, even after spending twice the planned cost of going carbon neutral.\u00a0READ:\u00a0The Green New Deal from Alexandria Ocasia-Cortez isn\u2019t so crazy after all, a commentaryIn fact, we can learn a lot about the emptiness of these promises \u2013 and how governments fiddle with their emissions numbers \u2013 by examining the little-known story of one of the first countries that vowed to achieve zero emissions.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementThis was New Zealand. In 2007, a year before she left office, then-Prime Minister Helen Clark set out her vision for the country to become carbon neutral by 2020. The United Nations duly hailed her as a \u201cChampion of the Earth.\u201d But cutting carbon is not as simple as gaining attention.The latest official statistics show that New Zealand\u2019s total emissions will actually be higher in 2020 than they were when Clark set her carbon-neutrality goal. And there has been an \u201cincreasing trend\u201d in emissions since 1990, as the government itself admits.Yet successive administrations have consistently trumpeted climate success, by relying on what authoritative assessments charitably call \u201ccreative accounting.\u201d\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nFor over two decades, climate change has prevented the Dutch Elfstedentocht ice skating event taking place in the Netherlands, so participants have held it on an Austrian lake instead. (Photo:\u00a0AFP/JOE KLAMAR)\n                            \n\n                    \n                \n    AdvertisementCREATIVE ACCOUNTINGUnder the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, New Zealand promised to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2008to 2012. Although much less ambitious than Clark\u2019s vision a decade later, the Kyoto pledge still entailed a meaningful cut of almost 13 per cent.But reducing emissions is hard, because it leaves countries worse off. Emissions are largely byproducts of productivity, and curtailing them implies higher costs.\u00a0So when 2008 to 2012 arrived, New Zealand\u2019s annual emissions had actually increased by more than 20 per cent since 1990.Despite this, the country\u2019s climate change minister claimed, \u201cNew Zealand meets Kyoto climate target.\u201dHow? From 1990 to 2002, New Zealand\u2019s private forest plantations increased by more than 1.4 million acres. Although not planted for climate purposes, these trees soak up carbon dioxide. New Zealand successfully negotiated to include this specific emission offset in its overall figures, neatly balancing the actual increase.For safety\u2019s sake, the country also bought lots of foreign offsets, including highly dodgy ones from Russia and Ukraine.But growing forests also reduced New Zealand\u2019s emissions in the comparison year of 1990. If we \u2013 more honestly \u2013 include the impact of forests and land use on emissions across the entire period from 1990 to 2008 to 2012, the country\u2019s net emissions during this period actually increased even more, by 38 per cent.READ:\u00a0Why recycling, less single-use plastics are not the answers to our plastic scourge, a commentaryThese days, New Zealand is promising to cut its emissions to 5 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 \u2013 still 95 per cent away from Clark\u2019s earlier target. Real emissions in 2020 will in fact be more than 23 per cent above 1990 levels.But by continuing to include the forest effect and the other leftover offsets from Kyoto, the government is already projecting that it will achieve its goal.EMPTY PROMISES AND AMBITIONSThis tells us two things. First, when it comes to climate change, the important thing is to look like you are doing something. Countries that manage that can get away with massaging the data.The 2015 Paris climate agreement is a great example of this. Countries made a grandiose commitment to keep the global increase in temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, but all their promises together add up to less than 1 per cent of what\u2019s needed.New analysis shows that only 17 countries \u2013 including Algeria and Samoa \u2013 are actually meeting their commitments, in most cases because they promised very little.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe World Bank has warned that Kiribati, which is only a few metres above sea level, may need to consider wholesale migration due to rising sea levels caused by climate change (Photo: AFP/TORSTEN BLACKWOOD)\n                            \n\n                    \n                The second lesson is that because honest and deep carbon cuts are staggeringly hard, achieving carbon neutrality anytime soon is an empty ambition for almost every country.Strip away the statistical legerdemain, and New Zealand will be a whopping 123 per cent off Clark\u2019s vision of zero emissions in 2020.Current Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern now promises to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. That\u2019s three decades later \u2013 but it won\u2019t happen by then, either.READ:\u00a0The ocean is changing \u2013 it\u2019s getting more acidic, a commentaryRISKS OF ABANDONMENTA government-commissioned report by the respected New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) shows that just reducing emissions to 50 per cent of 1990 levels in 2050 would cost NZ$28 billion (US$19.2 billion) annually by 2050.For a country like New Zealand, with a population the size of Ireland or Costa Rica, that\u2019s a big deal, about what the government spends now on its entire education and healthcare system.And that\u2019s only the cost of getting halfway to the carbon-neutrality target. According to the NZIER report, getting all the way will cost more than NZ$85 billion annually, or 16 per cent of projected GDP, by 2050. That is more than last year\u2019s entire national budget for social security, welfare, health, education, police, courts, defecse, environment, and every other part of government combined.The report says Kiwis would need to accept a carbon tax of almost NZ$1,500. This is equivalent to a gasoline tax of NZ$3.50 per litre.Other countries aiming for carbon neutrality face similarly eye-watering costs. The main economic models assessing the EU plan to reduce emissions by \u201cmerely\u201d 80 per cent by 2050 show average costs of US$1.4 trillion per year.And Mexico\u2019s pledge to cut emissions by just 50 per cent by 2050 will likely cost 7 to 15 per cent of GDP. Climate campaigners may cheer today, but these policies will be abandoned when voters start feeling the pain.We need to move away from a response to climate change that relies on stirring but undeliverable promises of carbon neutrality.Rather than forcing the rollout of currently inefficient green energy, governments should invest much more in research and development to make it cheaper for the future. Feel-good promises are easy politics, but they don\u2019t actually help the planet.Bjorn Lomborg, a visiting professor at the Copenhagen Business School, is director of the Copenhagen Consensus Centre.\u00a0"},

If coronavirus keeps going for a few more weeks, it will likely throw the elections to the right.IMPOSE MOVEMENT RESTRICTIONS?To my mind, the core issue behind the spread in South Korea is the country\u2019s basic political liberalism. South Korea is a free society. People enjoy freedom of movement, association, and religion.Should the South Korean state simply strip people of these freedoms in the circumstances of an epidemic? Indeed, can the South Korea state, constitutionally, even do that? (No one really knows.)Do we really want\u00a0to lock people up for weeks, just because they have a headache or a temperature?

That seems like a low bar to start declaring emergency civil liberties restrictions akin to wartime.The state has encouraged people to avoid congregations, to wash their hands, wear masks, and so on. But that is different than\u00a0using state power to quarantine people against their will.Coerced quarantine has been Japan\u2019s answer for the Diamond Princess cruise ship, and that has been very controversial, especially for the healthy people onboard.READ: Commentary: Japan shows how not to deal with a COVID-19 outbreakREAD:\u00a0Commentary: Hit hard by COVID-19, Singapore Airlines may need to pursue deeper capacity cutsA church in Daegu at the centre of the outbreak there similarly illustrates these tangled legal issues. Its congregants resisted state testing for coronavirus and held services when other churches desisted.The virus spread, and now the South Korean state is actively hunting down thousands of churchgoers who have not turned up.MOVE FASTER TO IMPOSE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS?When this is all over and the recriminations begin, I think Moon will take the greatest criticism over the lack of a China travel ban.\u00a0There is now nearly universal consensus across South Korean opinion that the president should have moved quickly to cut off China travel, much as many other countries did.In fact, at the time of this writing, South Korea still has not done that. The logic seems to be that now is too late, so what is the point?I have argued elsewhere that this hesitation is almost certainly political.\u00a0South Korea is open to pressure.

This is deeply attractive to the South Korean left which sees Japan as an opponent, an unrepentant colonialist of the past. And Trump\u2019s relentless picking on South Korea similarly creates a desire, especially on the left here, to draw distance from the Americans.READ: Commentary: New spats open all too familiar wounds between South Korea and JapanThe next few weeks will be crucial on this final point.

They join a plethora of big global brands like Starbucks, Coca-Cola,\u00a0and KFC in reducing their plastic footprint.All these options are a part of the overall solution but are not the crux of the real problem which stems from the 21st century\u2019s super-efficient supply chain system has seamlessly designed, sourced, manufactured and distributed materials and goods to consumers on such a large scale and low cost in virtually every nation of the world.\u00a0Paradoxically, it is both a supply chain system built on waste and convenience, but born out of necessity when it has provided needed infrastructure for some of our most basic needs such as food, water, and healthcare.Solutions that may appear logical on the surface, such as reducing usage, eliminating single-use plastic, and developing new product alternatives can lead to an even worse impact to the environment if the same supply chain system stays intact.READ:\u00a0Our reluctance to part with plastic bag stems from a 'yeah-but' mentality, a commentary\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA Revolv cup filled with Bushwick Kombucha tea used at EarthFest on Jan 20.

Middle class consumerism generates waste, but this is also a function of the improved health, sanitation and population control.\u00a0The efforts by large consumer product companies, such as Nestle, Starbucks, Coca Cola, and Pepsi to become more sustainable in their products is almost always well intended, but these campaigns without transformational changes to how their supply chains operate just leads to more publicity than results.\u00a0Grand plans driven by advances in technology, such as The Ocean Clean Up Project, can be lionised as the ultimate solution and raise tens of millions of funding dollars only to fail miserably in trying to achieve too ambitious a purpose.\u00a0Recycling programmes, industry sustainability campaigns and high-technology innovations have failed to accomplish much more than incremental improvements all at the same time the global plastic production is rising at nearly a 9 per cent rate per annum, and most of the 380 million metric tonnes produced is wasted, including 9 million tonnes spilled into the oceans every year.A NEW MODEL OF PLASTIC PRODUCTIONFundamentally, the world needs a new model for plastic that serves the purposes of good without the harmful impact to the environment and human health.\u00a0We need a new supply chain system of plastic that makes it both a material of economic growth and environmental sustainability rather than a choice of one over the other.\u00a0READ:\u00a0Dear Singapore, a plastic future is not fantastic, a commentaryFor this to occur, the first step is for plastic to be designed to be recycled in the first place.

Staying ahead of the maelstrom of political news, geopolitics, and the machinations of their rivals means such plans seldom work out as expected.Nowhere is this more true than over Brexit \u2013 and it is sending the country stumbling perhaps irrevocably to a chaotic \u201cno deal\u201d outcome that will likely usher in further instability.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster (C), attending the Conservative Party conference, has rejected any Brexit compromise on the Irish border AFP/Oli SCARFF                          \n                            \n\n                    \n                BRITAIN HEADING TOWARDS \u2018NO DEAL\u2019Only a few weeks ago, Britain\u2019s exit looked like it would be a relatively moderate affair, shaped by a series of compromises brokered by the prime minister with the cabinet at her Chequers country residence in July.That deal, however, has now been rejected both by much of her own party and then irritated European leaders last month in Salzburg. This week, May and her party appear to be moving towards a much harder break, perhaps no deal at all.That scenario, with all its implications for disruption of borders, markets and supplies is already doing Britain serious economic harm. One report estimated the country is now losing 500 million pounds a week in economic activity. So great is the uncertainty, however, that this damage is likely to escalate rapidly.Within the next year, it is entirely plausible that Britain will have a Eurosceptic conservative government slashing taxes and spending in the hope of creating a right-wing haven.Or a snap election could usher in the opposition Labour Party on exactly the opposite platform, raising taxes on the rich and major firms to fund dramatic public sector investment.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Houses of Parliament are seen at dusk in London, Britain, December 2, 2015.

There have been few realistic suggestions as to how those three options could be offered without multiple rounds of voting.And at the time of such unpredictability, finding consensus seems to be becoming ever harder.DAMAGE TO LIVESIt shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that this is now damaging not just Britain\u2019s national reputation, but real people\u2019s lives.When one of my personal care assistants unexpectedly quit last month, I phoned one of my regular care agencies for a replacement. They had no one, they said \u2013 the young foreign workers who have provided the backbone of support since my injury 12 years ago were simply no longer coming.I found an alternative privately, but this dynamic is now already rippling through business, agriculture, hospitality, healthcare and most other sections of the economy.READ:\u00a0Covering the world, paralysed from the shoulders down, a commentaryOn Tuesday (Oct 2), UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid outlined Britain\u2019s latest thinking on post-Brexit immigration policy, setting new limits to prioritise skilled labour.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nFILE PHOTO: Britain's Home Secretary Sajid Javid arrives at 10 Downing Street in London, Britain, July 3, 2018.

In Britain, there is no such clarity.One will occur when the government falls, and after May lost her outright majority at last year\u2019s general election \u2013 another short-term gambit that failed \u2013 that could happen any time.The hope must be that whatever the short-term problems, the Brexit saga sees a revitalisation of politics on both sides, allowing the country to focus its attention on the issues that really count.Before we get there, however, it looks set to be one heck of a ride."},

But one between a\u00a0US and North Korean leader\u00a0has always remained an unlikely prospect since the Americans\u00a0left the unfinished Korean War.More than half a century of pent-up anger, sanctions, sabre-rattling and diatribes between 11 US administrations and three successive North Korean leaders, have stalled nuclear disarmament talks and exacerbated tensions across the globe.This precarious backdrop sets the scene for this once unimaginable summit. And it\u2019s precisely why there is a desperate optimism in some quarters for a watershed moment, even as questions remain as to whether hot button issues like the Korean War and denuclearisation will be addressed.Writing for The National Interest, Robert E Kelly, associate professor of international relations at Pusan National University, described the summit as \"one of America's strangest meeting\" where he expected\u00a0very little and yet hoped\u00a0for the best.\"Indeed at this point, it looks to be a\u00a0nothing burger of photos and short, \u2018get to know you\u2019 meetings that yield nothing.

While there were other factors that led to the eventual Soviet downfall, Nixon\u2019s visit to China\u00a0arguably precipitated the beginning of the end of the Cold War, opened China to the rest of the world and helped in the normalisation of its relations with its adversary, Japan.\u201cFor East Asia, the last most important summit was probably the Nixon-Mao summit that changed the course of the Cold War,\u201d associate professor Bhubhindar Singh, a Northeast Asia expert from the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, told Channel NewsAsia.The world would head in a different direction from that moment.Not long after that momentous occasion, still within the theatre of the Cold War, another memorable summit drew global attention.The famous Geneva fireside chat between US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in November 1985\u00a0was another significant step towards ending the bitter conflict and the beginning of a temporary period of d\u00e9tente between the world powers.This meeting set the wheels in motion for subsequent summits between the two leaders, eventually paving the way for the end of the Cold War.Recent history has also recorded such unlikely get-togethers.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nFollowing decades of Cold War tensions, Barack Obama and Raul Castro, pictured in 2016, in announced a warming of relations in December 2014 AFP/STR\n                            \n\n                    \n                The meeting between former US President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro just three years ago, was the first between an American and Cuban leader in half a century that quickly unlocked the doors to diplomatic ties.Later in the same year, the world turned its attention to Asia, and specifically Singapore.Shattering nearly seven-decades of tension, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Taiwanese leader Ma Ying-jeou shook hands for almost a minute. Shifting in synchronised fashion from right to left for every camera flash to capture the historic moment, their smiles sustained throughout the handshake as a signal of solidarity.A watershed moment in cross-strait relations, said Chinese media, although hindsight might suggest\u00a0otherwise. It was historic based on its symbolism, but not the impact it had on the future.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe Xi-Ma summit in 2015 was the first time leaders from Beijing and Taipei met since Taiwan split from the mainland in 1949.

Suddenly, the interaction took a more measured tone - perhaps even presidential as some have observed.For now, it seems all is well and good.HOSTS OF HISTORYPreparations have been underway at frenetic pace with officials from both sides conducting high-level meetings and communicating directly with their Singaporean hosts.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis were crystal clear in their appreciation of Singapore\u2019s efforts in hosting the summit when they met their counterparts. \u00a0\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS Defense Secretary James Mattis and Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen meeting on the sidelines of the 16th Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore.

This meeting is also important for North Korea as it is in negotiation talks with the most important threat to its regime and national security,\"\u00a0associate professor Bhubhindar Singh\u00a0said.\u201cFor Trump, this meeting is to show his ability to \u2018resolve\u2019 the most difficult issue that other American administrations have failed to achieve. In more strategic terms, a deal here would reinforce America\u2019s advantage and military presence in Northeast Asia vis-\u00e0-vis China.\"Some believe this could be just the start of\u00a0a long drawn out process, especially in the sphere of denuclearisation.\"Kim is focused on the long game. If talks go forward after June, their differences over denuclearising Korea obviously won\u2019t be resolved in a day,\" wrote Kent Harrington, a former CIA senior analyst, in a commentary.Will the summit mirror the impact of the Nixon-Mao meeting? Or will it begin a process of d\u00e9tente as did the famous fireside chat? Will it quickly open doors to diplomatic ties? Or simply be written as an inconsequential historic event, as was the Xi-Ma meeting?All we know for now is that the magnitude of what\u2019s at stake cannot be overstated: The demands for North Korea\u2019s denuclearisation, the possibility of ending the Korean War and normalising relations on the Korean Peninsula, and the impact of all this on\u00a0the region and the rest of the world.The scheduled meeting between two eccentric world leaders, with the baggage of the past and present in tow, will draw all the attention from across the globe. Journalists and officials have already descended on the island in the thousands, casting a blinding spotlight on this tiny Southeast Asian country.According to associate professor Bhubhindar Singh: \u201cThe selection of Singapore says a lot of who Singapore is \u2013 an efficient, honest, neutral country that can be trusted to hold such an important summit.\u201dSingapore \u2013 known for its efficiency, infrastructure and organisational competency \u2013 has to pull out all the stops for this one.\u00a0 It\u2019s a mammoth task to be executed within a tight schedule.The world awaits the Singapore Summit on Jun 12, 2018.\u00a0\u00a0Watch our comprehensive coverage of the Trump-Kim summit live on YouTube from 7am on Tuesday (Jun 12).

Trump, however,\u00a0proclaimed the \"extraordinary progress\" that's been made since he outlined his vision for a brighter future for humanity a year ago at the same place.\u00a0Mirth followed, with laughter greeting Trump\u2019s speech (although he insisted diplomats were laughing \u201cwith\u201d him, not \u201cat\u201d him), when he also boasted of his administration's unprecedented achievement.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementBut underneath the unexpected amusement, there lies an\u00a0increasing global concern.In attempting to \"Make America Great Again\", Trump's foreign policy moves have been\u00a0seen by many as eroding and undermining\u00a0the triumvirate pillars of global peace \u2013 institutions, trade and\u00a0international norms\u00a0- that the US and its democratic allies championed after\u00a0World War II .Some observers have pointed out that Trump's words are merely\u00a0meant to appease his domestic support base and that essentially, US foreign policy under Trump hasn't changed much.\u00a0\"There have been studies that\u00a0show that substantially when it comes to Asia, not much has really actually changed. In terms of the number of US forces in Asia, its foreign policy makers coming for visits, a lot of the messages have not changed,\"\u00a0said Dr Hoo\u00a0Tiang Boon, an expert on US-China relations from the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS).\n    Advertisement\"Even though they are pushing the America First policy, they still maintain their alliance and relationship. But in terms of the way of communicating, that is certainly very different. And I think a lot of it is about domestic politics.\"But Dr Hoo also acknowledged, as many analysts have done,\u00a0the confusion and consternation that arise as a consequence of Trump's bellicose tweets and flip flopping policy statements.\u00a0However, it hasn't been all words.Trump has walked the talk on some key issues since entering office, and it's these decisions that have\u00a0been seen as undermining American credibility: Pulling out of multilateral agreements, trade wars and making unilateral decisions on key security issues.WALKING OUT ON THE WORLD?In less than two years since taking office, Trump has pulled the US out of an international\u00a0trade agreement (the Trans-Pacific Partnership), a global climate agreement (the Paris Agreement) and the UN Human Rights Council.\u00a0\u201cI was elected to represent the residents of Pittsburgh, not Paris,\u201d the leader of the world\u2019s only superpower said in the early months of his term.More than a year on, he\u00a0reiterated his unapologetic stance at the UN.Not only has Trump abandoned\u00a0major multilateral agreements, but he has been\u00a0critical of alliances such as the North-Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and global institutions - the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and most recently the World Trade Organization - saying the US was disadvantaged.READ: An imperfect United Nations still the world's best hope for international cooperation, a commentary\u201cThe US\u00a0will always choose independence and cooperation over\u00a0global governance, control and domination,\u201d Trump told the\u00a0world on\u00a0Tuesday.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel speaks to US\u00a0President Donald Trump during the second day of the G7 meeting in Charlevoix city of La Malbaie, Quebec, Canada, Jun\u00a09, 2018.

Institutions are much harder to build up than they are to destroy.\"\u00a0The scholars argued that, while the US helped to establish the system and has borne a significant share of the cost, \"it has greatly benefitted from its rewards\".Hundreds of scholars have signed on this statement since it was published.Trump's criticisms of these institutions\u00a0undermine that established - albeit imperfect - framework of global oversight and send dangerous\u00a0signals to the rest of the world.\u00a0And it\u2019s not just been broad, general hostility towards institutions.His Twitter tirades against key allies including the UK\u2019s Theresa May, Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau and Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel have also seen tensions rise between the countries. \u00a0While criticism is warranted where it\u2019s due, Trump's potshots at friends within NATO, while\u00a0shaking hands with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, have\u00a0raised questions over trust and the future of the alliance.\"The United States has lost influence with allies and is squandering much of its \u201csoft power\u201d in ways that will make it difficult to regain,\" wrote Daniel L Byman, a security expert\u00a0from Brookings Institute.According to a Pew survey last year, confidence in the US on international affairs declined in the first months of the Trump administration from the previous year \u2013 especially among its allies.\u00a0A Gallup poll published at the beginning of this year showed a significant drop in terms of foreign approval of US leadership, with Germany coming in as the \u201ctop-rated\u201d global power in the world.Meanwhile, questions over US credibility have also extended to trade - another key mechanism in the international system that helps mitigate\u00a0conflict.\u00a0TRADING BLOWS WITH CHINA AND OTHERS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What began as a tariff tit-for-tat between China and the US is now on the brink of a full on trade war between the world\u2019s two\u00a0largest economies. And based on the latest word from Trump, the worst isn\u2019t over yet.Having pulled out of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and midst of gridlocked negotiations with Canada, Trump has found his biggest battle on the economic front to be China.As the two giants collide, futile calls for restraint reverberate from everyone else as they observe with a caution that\u2019s accompanied by a \u201cwhat can we do\u201d shrug of the shoulders.READ: Trump admits friendship with China's Xi could be overREAD:\u00a0China is running out of American products to target in a trade war, a commentary\u00a0\u201cTrade wars are good, and easy to win,\u201d Trump said at the onset of this tariff turmoil.From an initial US$50 billion imposed on Chinese products, the US president has now imposed tariffs on another US$200 billion. That\u2019s how far it has come \u2013 not good, not easy and not yet won.Some have suggested that Trump\u2019s tariffs are aimed at containing China\u2019s rise,\u00a0which to a large extent is a result of the global economic system that the US helped establish and championed.Despite differences in political ideology, economic interdependence and integration in this global system have been fundamental to keeping the peace between a communist China and the capitalist West. There was too much at stake, it was believed, with both economies intertwined in trade, manufacturing and finance.READ:\u00a0Economists split on upcoming MAS policy decision amid trade risksBut now, that relationship seems to be in an economic quagmire.\u00a0China sees itself as the target of\u00a0the superpower that has long safeguarded the system,\u00a0according to some observers like Dr Hoo.\u201cThey are starting to think that basically what the Trump administration wants is to revise industrial policy,\" he said.\u00a0\"Which is why right now you look at the trade talks, it has produced nothing at all. According to (China\u2019s) interpretation, I think to some extent it\u2019s true, they think that America wants to change the entire Chinese economic policy which the Chinese are never going to do.\"Dr Hoo added: \"(China) thinks that behind a lot of these demands and requests the Americans are asking is a structural issue which means that, the Americans do not want China to rise. So they think of it right now that anything behind the trade demand is to keep China down.\u201dManaging China\u2019s rise has been an ongoing part of US battle for power in the international system.But Trump\u2019s trade war with China is not just about China because of the extent to which the interests of countries have become intertwined by decades of economic integration.\u00a0\n        \n            \n            \n                        \n\nChart showing the US-China trade balance, 2006-2017. AFP/Gal ROMA\n                \n        A knee-jerk re-calibration of the balance of trade has the potential to\u00a0threaten global growth. The World Bank warned in June that the\u00a0trade tensions could result in a similar situation to the 2008 financial crisis.\u00a0When trade wars and protectionism become tools for the world\u2019s superpower while it rejects multilateralism, it sets a dangerous precedent. And that pattern of rejecting a\u00a0multilateral approach has also been evident in how Trump has handled the nuclear issue with Iran and North Korea.PATIENCE WITH PYONGYANG, TOUGH ON TEHRANThe communication between Trump and Kim Jong Un is perhaps the epitome of extremes. From outright insults to veneration, the two have traversed the entire spectrum of speech.The historic Singapore summit back in June, according to many observers produced acknowledgement more than agreement of what\u2019s already been established.\u201cThe Trump administration will probably tout this as a Nobel-worthy effort by President Trump, but the Singapore summit produced little more than frothy statements without substance, with little accountability for Kim Jong Un to cease and dismantle his nuclear weapons program,\u201d wrote Jung H Pak, Senior Fellow in the Centre for East Asia Policy Studies at Brookings Institution, in her post-summit assessment.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nSince the summit between Trump and Kim, diplomatic negotiations between North Korea and the US have seemed to stall AFP/SAUL LOEB\n                            \n\n                    \n                Following the summit, North Korea\u2019s predictable unpredictability became apparent.Pyongyang returned to pugnacious rhetoric against Washington and there were reports of continued nuclear activity to the point where negotiations were stalled.But Trump remained uncharacteristically subdued. His administration insisted that Pyongyang was taking steps towards denuclearisation.Professor Alan Chong from RSIS questioned the trust.\u201cThey\u2019re now asking the US to grease the process further by giving another concession - they want a treaty drawn up to formally end the Korean War. And is Trump prepared to go along with that?\" he said.\"Why should anyone trust North Korea and its word? And there was of course Trump\u2019s controversial summit with Putin in Helsinki. What does this say about him being someone who is rational and wise in foreign policy?\u201dThe critics \u2013 both domestic and abroad - have been quick to raise questions about standards again.Trump has gone to great lengths to appease Kim and endure his unpredictability. It\u2019s a level of patience that has not been accorded to anyone else \u2013 not even the closest allies \u2013 and a stark contrast to the treatment of Iran.Washington swiftly withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, calling it \u201cinsane\u201d and \u201cridiculous\u201d, while at the same time threatening Iran if it got back on the nuclear bandwagon. And of course, Trump signed on sanctions too.According to UN inspectors, Tehran had kept to its commitments to the deal.But the US president\u2019s language was firm and fierce from the onset \u2026 no pleasantries exchanged here. And despite their pleas, there was no real get-together or consultation with allies who helped implement the deal.The policy inconsistency has been apparent for analysts like Professor Chong.\u201cPeople are asking on another front that if you treat North Korea with kid gloves, i.e. the summit and the vague agreements they cobbled together in that one day,\" he said.\"You know what does it mean for dealing with Iran in a hard-line fashion? Why is Iran more intractable in Trump\u2019s perspective or more unlikeable than North Korea?\u201dTrump\u2019s address at UN General Assembly on Tuesday highlighted, once again, the obverse approaches. While calling for isolation of Iran, he praised \u201cChairman Kim for his courage\u201d.The Iran deal wasn\u2019t perfect. But perfection is an unrealistic requirement of an agreement such as this.\u00a0Let\u2019s not forget the widely discussed inadequacies of the Trump-Kim agreement that spawned from the June summit.Is this the new norm in international relations that the US champions? Where years of belligerence is rewarded and compliance punished? Where multilateral agreements are supplanted by unilateral decisions?\u201cYou cannot assume that you can wing it based on your own judgement. You have to consider other people\u2019s advice,\"\u00a0said Prof Chong.\u00a0\"And sometimes the best foreign policy decisions are those recommended to you and you are persuaded by someone else\u2019s view. And this is apparently not happening with Donald Trump. So that\u2019s a worrying thing. This sense of unilateralism - with a small 'u' - that is, Trump mainly doing things his way more than through cooperation with countries,\u00a0\u00a0this is the frightening part.\"Protectionism, tariffs, reneging on multilateral agreements, disregarding global institutions and allies - all purposeful transgressions from international norms by the one who's looked up\u00a0to as the global standard-bearer.The international system is a long way from collapsing, but Trump\u2019s foreign policy and his attitude towards global cooperation and consensus have left the rest of the world rather anxious as they\u00a0wait for his next impulsive act.And along with fractured economic relations, undermined international institutions and transgressed norms, the world becomes a volatile place.\u201cWe reject the ideology of globalism and accept the doctrine of patriotism,\u201d Trump told the world on Tuesday.The two need not be\u00a0mutually exclusive.\u00a0"},

Even a complete wipe-out of corporate profits this year need not justify more than a few per cent off share prices.WHY STOCK PRICES MIGHT TAKE A BIGGER HAMMERINGThis argument does not, of course, constitute investment advice \u2013 rather a criticism of markets\u2019 functioning.

Macroeconomic policy does need to react forcefully even if this shock originates in a supply disruption. Fiscal and monetary stimulus should sustain weakening demand, and monetary and financial policy should be used to prevent liquidity problems caused by the supply shock.If policymakers do not act appropriately, the economic impact will be both more severe and more protracted than it needs to be.LISTEN: Singapore Budget 2020: A report cardREAD: Commentary: The great COVID-19 disruption to Asian economies has begunThird, one cannot rule out the \u201ctail risk\u201d of permanent damage to the world\u2019s economic capacity. The less likely way this could happen is if the new virus becomes endemic and constitutes a lasting addition to the world\u2019s disease burden and drag on its economic activity.The more likely way is again though policy: The temporary disruption of global value chains and the increased awareness of international interdependence could lead to efforts to restructure global production within narrower national or regional boundaries.COVID-19 could cause more economic damage by tilting the balance in favour of deglobalisation than by making people sick.BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of novel coronavirus\u00a0and its developmentsDownload\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegram"},

If some Western news headlines are anything to go by, the policy has sparked anxiety, fear, anger, and even hatred, in addition to the trade war.Some of the outside fear and anxiety is justified. Given China\u2019s track record in intellectual property protection, and widely held beliefs in Beijing\u2019s unfair trade practice, it is not surprising that the prospect of China dominating industries of the future has set off alarm bells.This has not been helped by a recent surge in patriotic propaganda in China (for example, the nationwide screening of the documentary Amazing China), which has been criticised by some Chinese observers as Boxer-style nationalism.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0READ:\u00a0The great disconnect between China the 'developing country' and China the great power, a commentaryECONOMIC NATIONALISM VERSUS\u00a0GLOBALISATIONIndeed, the very term Made in China 2025\u00a0itself is probably ill-thought-out. One can discuss Industry 4.0\u00a0without ever mentioning the country behind it; not so with Made in China 2025.And the problem goes deeper than just branding, it reflects a contradiction between economic nationalism and the reality of the globalisation of innovation, research\u00a0and development.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nA man takes photos of a party flag of Communist Party of China made with flowers, which promotes the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), in Shanghai, China September 30, 2017.

As former chief judge for the World Trade Organisation James Bacchus argues:China isn\u2019t going to climb the competitive ladder by discriminating against foreign goods and services (and) shutting out foreign companies.In the past few decades, China\u2019s rise has in large part been a result of its integration into the global production networks. Its continued development now hinges on its even deeper integration with the global innovation networks.If it is for this reason that China has downplayed the Made in China 2025\u00a0slogan, it is a good thing.But Trump\u2019s wrecking-ball approach to dealing with China is the other side of the same economic nationalism coin.For the same reason of global economic and technological interdependence, Trump\u2019s punitive measures to stop China from upgrading its industry will not work. If anything, it could backfire.READ:\u00a0We may be in the early stages of a new Cold War, a commentaryA MISUNDERSTOOD POWER COMPETITIONPast technology bans by the US have ironically spurred China\u2019s progress in areas such as supercomputers and aerospace.After the US announced a seven-year ban on US companies supplying key components to the Chinese telecom company ZTE, Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed to redouble China\u2019s efforts to develop its own core technologies.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nThe logo of China's ZTE Corp is seen at the lobby of ZTE Beijing research and development centre building in Beijing, China, June 13, 2018.

Over the course of my tenure as US Secretary of Commerce, the vice premier and I had developed a warm and candid relationship.Since this was to be our last official meeting, I decided to do something a bit different: Take him to rural Virginia for a traditional Thanksgiving meal.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementWhile we were surrounded by our usual phalanx of security, we effectively sat alone, with the exception of our two closest aides. Shortly after we were seated, the vice premier leaned in close and almost whispered to me:Can you explain what just happened in your presidential election?Clearly, the Chinese were just as surprised by the results as we were.I told the vice premier that we were still trying to understand the outcome ourselves, but that it was important for him to appreciate that China had played a significant role in the election. As the translator spoke into his ear, he shot me a somewhat surprised look.\u00a0\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementI explained that then-candidate Donald Trump\u2019s \u201ctough on China\u201d rhetoric had tapped into an underlying strain of thought in the US that Wang and other Chinese leaders needed to understand.CHINA A DEVELOPING COUNTRY?For years, Americans were told that China was a developing country and shouldn\u2019t necessarily be held to the same standard as developed nations such as the US. But China\u2019s success had severely undercut that line of reasoning.The Chinese economy was growing at 6 per cent or more annually. Chinese cities, roads, ports and bridges were rising seemingly overnight. The world\u2019s low-cost manufacturer was rapidly becoming a global technology hub. And the Chinese government was investing billions of yuan\u00a0in support of its \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d industrial plan.\n    Advertisement\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Beijing's development plan - Made in China 2025 - maps out the country's strategy to dominate \"every hot industry\" from space to telecommunications to robotics to electric cars.

They were seeing their middle-class jobs and once-prosperous lifestyles disappearing.\u00a0China wasn\u2019t playing fairly; it was consistently violating its international commitments and tilting the playing field to advantage Chinese firms. Economic complexities aside, the fact that Americans were, in part, paying the bill for such behavior had begun to sink in with millions of my fellow citizens.Candidate Trump, of course, didn\u2019t create these imbalances; he was simply very effective at tapping into this growing resentment. With or without Trump, the US-China relationship was moving quickly toward a crossroads.READ:\u00a0We may be in the early stages of a new Cold War, a commentaryREAD: Fork in the road as brewing trade war hints at revision of US-China relations, a commentaryMODERN CHINA A REALITYThe point I was making to the vice premier is that, as China has risen to become a global power, the dynamic between the two countries has unquestionably changed. Meanwhile, too many Chinese actions and policies have not.In fact, Chinese officials still frequently rely on the outdated rhetoric that China is merely a developing country. The developing nation narrative is clearly at odds with the observable reality of modern China, and it logically runs counter to China\u2019s lofty goal of establishing a \u201cnew model of great power relations\u201d between the US and China \u2014 a dynamic focused on fostering cooperation and competition but avoiding confrontation, which, historically, has been the defining feature of relations between existing and rising powers.It is hard to be both a poor, developing nation and a party to a \u201cnew model of great power relations.\u201d The formulation assumes the existence of two great powers. In the modern world, though, being a great power requires leadership.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe skyline of Pudong, the financial district of Shanghai, is pictured on Apr\u00a07, 2018.

It requires playing by the same rules and competing fairly, not relying on state resources to support domestic industries and innovation.If China wants to be the world\u2019s other great power, it is manifestly in its interest to start acting like one.DISCONNECT BETWEEN WORDS AND REALITYTo be fair, we have seen China emerge as a global leader on certain issues \u2014 such as climate \u2014 and, in recent months, President Xi Jinping has spoken consistently about China assuming a larger role in world affairs. In other areas, however, particularly those tied to economic and trade policy, the rhetoric continues to surpass the policies.In part, it was this disconnect between words and reality that gave Trump his political resonance in the US China is a great power. China has risen and, in so doing, has lifted 800 million people out of poverty.But, if China doesn\u2019t change its approach to economic competition, I fear that today\u2019s trade war will be nothing compared to the heightened tensions to come. Frankly, our domestic political system will demand action and President Trump will look like the mild first incarnation of a trend rather than an outlier.READ:\u00a0US-China trade war to continue on for years, not months, a commentaryRELATIONS DEEPER THAN EVERThe irony, of course, is that in so many important respects the economic and personal ties between the US and China are deeper than ever:The US hosted roughly 130,000 Chinese graduate students during the 2016 to 2017 academic year. On average, each of those Chinese students spends more than US$26,000 per year in the US.Chinese direct investment in the US expanded dramatically to US$46 billion in 2016, before a steep decline in 2017. That investment has hyper-charged a range of sectors in all corners of the US.Less than 10 years, spending from Chinese tourists in the US has more than quadrupled to over US$20 billion annually. Xi and then-President Barack Obama agreed to offer new 10-year tourist visas to citizens of both countries, so we can expect that number to grow.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nStudents clap while Chinese President Xi Jinping delivers a speech during a visit to Lincoln High School in Tacoma, Washington, Sep\u00a023, 2015.

In that time, this system has limited conflict and led to the greatest increase in prosperity the world has ever seen.Without question, particularly over the last two decades, China has reaped the benefits of this rules-based order not just by competing aggressively but, it must be said, at times exploiting the existing system. That must change.If it doesn\u2019t, I fear that the stated goal of this \u201cnew model of great power relations\u201d \u2014 competitive cooperation \u2014 will fall victim to China\u2019s inability to change course. Then the politically plausible options for navigating China\u2019s rise over the decades to come will be narrowed down to one: confrontation.Penny Pritzker served as US Secretary of Commerce from 2013 to 2017.

A commentaryA CLEARER CHINA POLICYSo what do we make of it? For one thing, this speech outlines a clearer and more comprehensive China policy for the Trump administration, which so far has been seen as largely one-dimensional and trade-oriented.This new China policy is also characterised by increased assertiveness from Washington. To use Pence\u2019s words: \u201cWe will not be intimidated; we will not stand down,\u201d a refrain repeated several times throughout the speech.More importantly, this comprehensive and assertive turn in China policy is likely to go down well on both sides of US politics. And for this reason alone, the speech needs to be taken seriously.Even as some commentators fault it for lacking a well-articulated competitive strategy against the threat, most in the US do not question the accuracy of Pence\u2019s accusations, which, after all, have been rehearsed through years of extensive Western media and academic coverage of China\u2019s various sins.In fact, Pence\u2019s attacks on China play into a mounting sense of frustration with China\u2019s inability and unwillingness to fulfil American hope that:(F)reedom in China would expand in all forms \u2013 not just economically, but politically, with a newfound respect for classical liberal principles, private property, religious freedom, and the entire family of human rights.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThis US Navy photo shows the Guided-missile destroyer USS Decatur (DDG 73) as it operates in the South China Sea.

This is what is most concerning about the Pence speech.Chengxin Pan is associate professor of international relations in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Deakin University.

China's ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai, in an interview with National Public Radio aired shortly before Pence's address, said there was a \"much larger need for cooperation\" than competition with Washington.Relations between the world's two largest economies have plummeted in recent weeks with Trump placing US$250 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods, in part over charges that Beijing forces US companies to hand over technological know-how.Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, separately said that the United States was speaking to the European Union and Japan about taking joint action against China.Speaking before the Economic Club of Washington, Kudlow -\u00a0with echoes of the Iraq war -\u00a0spoke of a \"trade coalition of the willing to confront China.\"Pence lashed out at China for focusing its retaliatory tariffs on states vital to the Republicans' electoral chances.He also slammed Beijing for placing a multi-page advertisement extolling the virtues of US-China trade in the Des Moines Register, the highest-circulation newspaper in Iowa, a swing state whose longtime governor Terry Branstad is Trump's ambassador to Beijing.Such paid supplements by foreign governments are commonplace in US newspapers, but Pence complained that the United States was not allowed to print similar advertisements in China's state-controlled press.HAILING TAIWAN AS MODELTouching a particularly sensitive issue for China, Pence attacked Beijing for coaxing three more Latin American nations to switch recognition from Taiwan.\"These actions threaten the stability of the Taiwan Strait -\u00a0and the United States of America condemns them,\" Pence said.The democratic, self-governing island is home to nationalists who fled in 1949 after losing China's civil war and has waged an increasingly lonely campaign for diplomatic recognition as the Republic of China.Pence made clear that the United States still adhered to its four-decade policy of recognising only Beijing but added to applause: \"Let me also say that Taiwan's embrace of democracy shows a better path for all the Chinese people.\"Pence also accused Beijing of showing its \"aggression\" when a Chinese navy vessel recently sailed in the dispute-ridden South China Sea near the USS Decatur destroyer, which according to US officials had to make a quick detour to avoid collision.READ:\u00a0Chinese destroyer sailed extremely close to US warship, says\u00a0US official\"Despite such reckless harassment, the United States Navy will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows and our national interests demand,\" Pence said.\"We will not be intimidated; we will not stand down.\"The vice president, a favourite of conservative US Christians, also criticised China on human rights, voicing disappointment that rising prosperity has not led to reforms.China \"has taken a sharp U-turn toward control and oppression,\" Pence said, adding: \"A new wave of persecution is crashing down on Chinese Christians, Buddhists and Muslims.\"\"UNWARRANTED\"\u00a0AND \"RIDICULOUS\"Responding to Pence's charges, China on Friday\u00a0slammed the vice president, saying his accusations were\u00a0\"unwarranted\" and \"ridiculous\".\"The relevant speech made unwarranted accusations against China's domestic and foreign policies and slandered China by claiming that China meddles in US internal affairs and election,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement.\"This is nothing but speaking on hearsay evidence, confusing right and wrong and creating something out of thin air.

But, unlike economists\u2019 favorite approach to climate change \u2013 set the right price for carbon and leave the rest to private decisions \u2013 the Green New Deal rightly encompasses the many dimensions of what must be a fundamental transformation of our economies and our societies if the climate challenge is to be met successfully.The transition to a carbon-neutral economy is bound to be as revolutionary as the transition to the industrial age. Given the comprehensive nature of this transition, it cannot be summarised in one price.It must be a collective endeavour in which governments invest and every citizen finds his or her role. The optimistic, participatory ethos of the Green New Deal should be commended.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementREAD: America's short-lived shale oil resurgence, a commentaryBut let\u2019s be clear: The green transition will not be a free lunch. There is no doubt that life and work will be far better if we succeed in containing climate change than if we fail, which is the rationale for undertaking the corresponding efforts.Yet that is not the question many citizens are asking. Their baseline expectation \u2013 unrealistic, but understandable \u2013 is a business-as-usual scenario in which they continue to consume and travel according to their current habits.They may accept eating a little less meat and using more efficient cars, provided their purchasing power does not change. And they may wish to change jobs, if the new one is better paid and less stressful. But there is little evidence that most citizens are ready for more.\n    AdvertisementREAD:\u00a0\u00a0Eating less meat is a climate priority, a commentaryHERE\u2019S THE HARSH REALITYUnderstandably, Green New Deal supporters tend to pander to these feelings. The Ocasio-Cortez proposal is vague enough to evade precise criticisms, but what is evident is that it does not put a finger on anything that may hurt. The same applies to many plans that promise a nicer life together with more and better jobs.The truth is unfortunately quite different. The transition to a carbon-neutral economy is bound to make us worse off before it makes us better off, and the most vulnerable segments of society will be hit especially hard.Unless we acknowledge and address this reality, support for greening the economy will remain shallow and it may eventually wane.The reason brings us back to the economists\u2019 favorite instrument: Prices. One way or another, we must start paying for something \u2013 carbon \u2013 that we have been consuming for free. And putting a price on carbon is bound to reduce overall consumption.READ:\u00a0Soon, our food won't be grown in soil, a commentaryThe cause is not the tax, the proceeds of which can be redistributed to taxpayers, for example, on a per capita basis, as an impressive group of US economists has proposed.Rather, putting a price on carbon inevitably will result in what economists call a negative supply shock. Some equipment will become unusable, and some technologies will no longer be profitable.Maximum production (what economists call potential GDP) will decline. If the price hike is abrupt, a slump will follow, as occurred in 1974, when oil producers suddenly hiked prices. A corollary is that wealth drops as the value of fuel-inefficient houses, gluttonous cars, and oil companies\u2019 shares declines.HURTS WORKING-CLASS JOBSThe problem does not come from the use of a price instrument. It would be the same in a planned economy: Carbon efficiency would also require old, inefficient equipment to be discarded and additional investment so that GDP becomes less carbon-intensive.With recent estimates putting the required additional investment at some 2 per cent of GDP annually in 2040, a correspondingly smaller share of output will be available for household consumption.Furthermore, the distributional effects of the green transition are unfortunately adverse. The poor and the suburban middle class spend more of their income on energy than the rich and the urban professionals do, and often lack the means to buy a new, efficient heating system or to insulate their house.And, because working-class jobs tend to be more carbon-intensive, factory workers and truck drivers will be hurt more than designers and bankers.The problem our societies are facing is massive. It should not be hidden. The French government had to backtrack after the Yellow Vests revolted against a \u20ac55 (US$63) per tonne fuel tax, but a recent estimate of what its needed to decarbonise put the rate at \u20ac250 per tonne in 2030.READ:\u00a0The yellow vest, a symbol of a rising political movement in France, a commentaryEuropean countries, already agonising over increasing their defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP, as US President Donald Trump has demanded, now face the prospect of paying another 2 per cent for the transition to a carbon-free economy.For decades, people have been given incentives to move from city centres to the suburbs, and now they are being told that their lifestyle has no future.REDISTRIBUTION WILL BE NEEDEDFortunately, these effects can be softened. The full redistribution of carbon tax proceeds can alleviate the burden on the most vulnerable. In an environment of ultra-low interest rates, debt finance is a rational way to accelerate economic transformation while spreading the corresponding cost across generations.\u00a0As the astonishing drop in the cost of solar panels suggests, fostering innovation and competition will help accelerate the emergence of clean, efficient technologies.And the earlier action is taken, and the more predictable the long-term outlook, the easier it will be to adapt, and the less adverse the impact on production and wealth will be. Abrupt changes devalue existing assets, while a smooth transition enables the right investments at the right time.That said, realism compels us to recognise that nothing can fully eliminate the hardship involved in the transition.To win, Green New Deal enthusiasts must be honest with citizens about what the coming transformation will entail, how its costs will be minimized and equitably shared, and what role they can play. Rather than portraying their scenario as rosy, they should show that it is feasible.\u00a0Jean Pisani-Ferry, a professor at the Hertie School of Governance (Berlin) and Sciences Po (Paris), holds the Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa chair at the European University Institute and is a senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank.

Both are in critical condition.The case immediately drew comparisons to Alexander Litvinenko, an ex-spy who died of radioactive polonium poisoning in London in 2006.

This is not what we voted for. This is an outrage,\" he said in a 35-minute address that was interrupted by repeated bursts of laughter and cheers.The wide-ranging speech was widely seen as Johnson's audition for May's job before the party faithful at their annual gathering.Some 1,500 people packed a conference hall room after queueing for hours to see May's political nemesis deliver his biggest address since he quit the government in protest in July.Johnson did little to douse suspicions of an eventual leadership challenge, using his characteristic swagger and wit to pick apart May's proposal - while not actually spelling out what Britain should do instead.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementHe said he wanted to force May to reverse her bid to keep close economic ties with the European Union once Britain leaves in March.May appeared intent on stealing Johnson's spotlight, scheduling a flurry of morning interviews at which she unveiled a new immigration policy a day ahead of schedule.Free movement of EU workers was a key issue in the 2016 vote for Brexit, and May confirmed that Europeans would be treated the same as non-EU citizens in future.She took to the airwaves again after Johnson's appearance, telling Sky News dismissively that he \"always puts on a good show\" while she focuses on things that mattered to people's \"day-to-day lives\".\n    AdvertisementMay's public battle with Johnson comes only two weeks before she must return to Brussels in a bid to break the Brexit deadlock and reach a deal.The prime minister hinted at a possible compromise on how to keep the land border with Ireland open after Brexit, a key sticking point in the EU talks, on which London is due to publish new plans shortly.ALTERNATIVE PLANJohnson was a leading campaigner for Brexit in the referendum. Even after being appointed foreign minister, he continually challenged May's EU strategy.He quit after May got the remaining ministers to rally around her proposal for Britain to follow EU rules for goods after Brexit.May says the so-called \"Chequers\" plan will keep trading lines open with its biggest trading partner.Johnson argues it will keep London tied to the bloc and ignore the people's expressed wish to leave the bloc.The EU has also rejected May's vision, saying it undermines the its cherished single market.Numerous eurosceptic Conservative MPs have already drawn big crowds in Birmingham as they offer their own idea for a looser trade arrangement with the EU.Johnson endorses the same alternative proposal, but the mop-haired former London mayor has particular star appeal.He was mobbed by jostling cameras on arrival and chased by reporters as he walked, with his address airing live across the nation.\"It's important to support the only politician I can see who is actively campaigning to give people the Leave that they voted for,\" said Colette Wyatt-Lowe, 71, a councillor from the outskirts of London, while queueing to hear Johnson speak.'HE'S\u00a0A\u00a0CLOWN'Johnson is known for his confrontational style and before the event he was captured in a press photograph running through a field of long grass.It clearly mocked May, who once said the naughtiest thing she had done was run through a field of wheat.But Johnson's recent comments about her Brexit plan, calling it \"deranged\" and saying it strapped a suicide vest to the British constitution, have angered many fellow MPs.Several former colleagues used the conference to make jokes at his expense, while finance minister Philip Hammond said his alternative Brexit plan was \"fantasy\".Even former Brexit minister David Davis, a fellow eurosceptic who describes Johnson as a \"great mate\", said many of his ideas \"are good headlines but not necessarily good policies\".Among the delegates, there is also unease about Johnson's public disagreements with May.Mike Kay, a 34-year-old delegate from Manchester in northwest England, summarised the mood of Johnson's critics. \"A large section of the country thinks he is a clown,\" he said."},

But after two days of theatrical amity in Pyongyang it appeared to mark a return to the North's traditional hardline position.The North's foreign ministry took exception to Pompeo's effort to secure concrete commitments to back Kim's promise, made at a summit last month with US President Donald Trump, to work towards the \"denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\".NAIVE AND GULLIBLE\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementAnd it did so in stark terms, according to a statement relayed by the KCNA state news agency.\"The US is fatally mistaken if it went to the extent of regarding that the DPRK would be compelled to accept, out of its patience, demands reflecting its gangster-like mindset,\" the statement said, referring to North Korea by its official initials.Pyongyang noted that it had already destroyed a nuclear test site - a concession that Trump has already publicly hailed as a victory for peace - and lamented that Pompeo had proved unwilling to match this with US concessions.It dismissed Trump's unilateral order to suspend joint US and South Korean war games as a cosmetic and \"highly reversible\" concession and criticised US negotiators who \"never mentioned\" the subject of bringing the 1953 Korean War to a a formal end with a peace treaty.\n    Advertisement\"We thought that the US side would come with a constructive proposal which accords with the spirit of the DPRK-US summit meeting and talks,\" it added. \"But this expectation and hope of ours were so naive as to be gullible.\"The North Korean statement came in stark comparison to the hopeful words Pompeo had given reporters before boarding his plane to Tokyo, and appear to represent a set-back to the process initiated between Kim and Trump last month.Pompeo had characterised the meeting as a success, but critically he failed to present any new details as to how North Korea would honour its summit commitment to \"denuclearise\" in exchange for US security guarantees.\"These are complicated issues, but we made progress on almost all of the central issues, some places a great deal of progress, other places there's still more work to be done,\" Pompeo said.Pompeo was speaking after emerging from more than eight hours of talks over two days with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's right-hand man Kim Yong Chol in a Pyongyang diplomatic compound.Last month, Kim agreed to \"work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula\" in return for security guarantees and an end to a dangerous stand-off with US forces.Trump hailed this as a successful resolution of the crisis. But the short joint statement was not a detailed roadmap to disarmament and it fell to Pompeo to follow up and put meat on the bones of the sparse commitment.'NO-ONE WALKED AWAY'\"We talked about what the North Koreans are continuing to do and how it's the case that we can get our arms around achieving what Chairman Kim and President Trump both agreed to,\" Pompeo said.\"No-one walked away from that, they're still equally committed,\" he said, just hours before the North issues their own, less optimistic, view of the negotiations.In practical terms, Pompeo mentioned only that officials from both sides would meet on Jul\u00a012 as a working group to discuss the repatriation of the remains of some US soldiers killed during the 1950-1953 Korean War.And he said some progress had been made towards agreeing \"the modalities\" of North Korea's destruction of a missile facility.Professor Yang Moo-Jin at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul said Pyongyang wants to separate \"US bureaucrats from President Trump, expressing trust in him\".\"This is not to break the talks. The North is trying to get an upper hand in further negotiations,\" he explained.\"North Korea expected Pompeo to bring a concrete proposal for security guarantee but it was disappointed as the US side reiterated the old demand that the North should denuclearise first before the US gives it anything in return.\"Pompeo, who was on his third visit to Pyongyang, began the outreach when he was still Trump's CIA director and remained the pointman on negotiations after the process became public and he became secretary of state."},

The pushback by Australian shoppers has been the cause of much amusement and bewildered head-shaking.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementBut there\u2019s one aspect of people\u2019s resistance to this type of change that has major implications for every environmental initiative in the country.

They know about the dangers of throwaway plastic, whether it be bags, straws or bottles. They know that eating farmed meat, leaving the tap running, and driving cars powered by fossil fuels are not good for the world we live in.They know this situation is not sustainable and that someone must do something about it.

A commentaryKNOWLEDGE ALONE WON\u2019T DRIVE BEHAVIOUR CHANGEEncouraging people to adopt new behaviours \u2013 especially those that involve personal inconvenience \u2013 is traditionally done through a \u201cstandard learning hierarchy approach\u201d.The first step is to provide people with new knowledge and information on a topic or issue, thus increasing their understanding. As a result they will change the way they feel about the topic, and ultimately change their behaviour to reflect this new understanding and feeling.Research has shown, however, that giving people new knowledge doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019ll do the right thing.For years, organisations have been telling us how bad plastic bags are for the environment.\u00a0As a result, people have been feeling increasingly negative towards the use of plastic bags. But despite some shoppers changing their ways, many haven\u2019t. Most supermarkets\u00a0still supply\u00a0millions of single-use bags, and millions of their customers are still using them.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nPeople carry shopping bags through the carpark of a Tesco supermarket in Birkenhead, north-west England.

One shopper said:It\u2019s just one extra thing (to remember) and invariably as I get older my memory gets worse.Clearly the standard learning hierarchy wasn\u2019t working here. The Yeah-buts persisted because their unwillingness to be inconvenienced by the need to provide their own shopping bags triumphed over their knowledge of the harm that plastic bags do.For these people, the inconvenience of forgetting their bags is acute, whereas the guilt over using unnecessary plastic is more vague.\u00a0Under pressure from environmental groups and concerned individuals, governments may introduce\u00a0a legislated ban on single-use plastic bags. This is a different approach to the standard learning hierarchy, which seeks to change people\u2019s perception first, and then their behaviour.Here, people\u2019s behaviour will hopefully be forcibly altered in the hope that their knowledge and feelings would catch up.The idea that people will reject an opportunity to acquire a new habit that will bring positive environmental change because it inconveniences them is one that clearly needs more research.\u00a0It\u2019s hard to think of another example where this inconvenience has resulted from a government mandating the withdrawal of a legal product to benefit the environment.BAN PLASTIC BAGSThe case of the plastic bag ban is still being analysed, but could it provoke copycat behaviour by other environmental agencies \u2013 lobbying for legislation to force people to take a particular course of action while waiting for them to realise it\u2019s the \u201cright\u201d thing to do and it makes them feel good?\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nShoppers check-out at a plastic bag-free Woolworths supermarket in Sydney, Australia, June 15, 2018.

If it does seem to work, watch out for a slew of applications from other environmental agencies and charities for similar levels of strong-arm government support.But those organisations will have to be prepared to weather a severe storm of backlash and negative public sentiment if they think legislation is the way to go.\u00a0Anne Lane is\u00a0researcher at Queensland University of Technology.

Several major banks in Hong Kong and Singapore - including HSBC , Morgan Stanley and DBS Bank - have restricted travel to mainland China and are allowing staff to work from home.On Tuesday, Chevron Corp asked about 300 British employees to work from home indefinitely after an employee in its London office reported a flu-like illness.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementThe financial industry is also discussing with regulators rules that may need to be temporarily waived if staff are unable to get to work, since some functions require personnel to be physically onsite. For example, processing trades and monitoring trading communications remain heavily manual processes, he said.The Wall Street planning effort comes amid growing fears that countries are struggling to contain the flu-like virus, prompting governments from Iran to Australia to shut schools, cancel big public events and stock up on medical supplies.On Thursday, the US\u00a0Commodity Futures Trading Commission told Reuters it is closely monitoring trading as fears of a pandemic pummel markets, sinking global equities, pushing oil futures to their lowest in a year and roiling wheat and corn markets.The Basel Committee of banking regulators, an international regulatory body, said banks and regulators should be ready to share information across borders as it tries to assess the financial stability implications of the outbreak.\n    AdvertisementFederal regulators published guidance in 2007 on how the financial industry should plan for a potential pandemic. That followed a 2007 exercise in which the government and financial industry tested the resilience of banks and other financial firms in the face of a hypothetical flu pandemic.That three-week exercise found that while there would be a significant impact on the financial sector, markets would continue to operate. SIFMA typically coordinates the industry's continuity planning efforts, and carries out regular drills.\"Our job is to do as much preparedness as we can ... and to be as resilient as possible,\" said Bentsen. \"That's been up and running for several weeks now, and we're prepared.\"BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of novel coronavirus\u00a0and its developmentsDownload our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegram"},

It was the South Koreans who broke from just about every other comment on North Korea at the Dialogue, and my general impression of the delegates\u2019 response was enormous scepticism.Moon is putting tremendous faith in a sudden conversion of Kim Jong-un to better behaviour. This reflects South Korea\u2019s remarkable optimism about the current summitry.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Moon Jae-in met in the border truce village where they held their first summit last month (Photo: AFP/Handout)\n                            \n\n                    \n                When I speak on panels in South Korea now, I am the lone hawk or sceptic. Perhaps Moon is right; perhaps he sees something the rest of us do not. But I worry that Moon may push to continue the process with North Korea long after South Korea\u2019s partners start to feel it is more of the same \u2013 endless talk with no clear resolution.No final deal resolving the North Korean nuclear issue will hold up over time if South Korea, the US, and Japan are this far apart. As the Japan Times put it, we are all keeping up a \u201cunited facade\u201d as the differences widen.SCEPTICISM\u00a0ON NORTH KOREA COMPLIANCEBy my count, US, South Korean, Japanese, Canadian, British, Australian, and French government speakers all explicitly referenced CVID across various plenary sessions. It was so relentless that it almost felt coordinated.But of course, almost no one in the analyst community believes the North will do this.Pyongyang spent almost fifty years developing these weapons. It endured extraordinary sanctions, isolation, and economic costs to get them. Nuclear missiles provide it direct nuclear deterrence against the US mainland, and thereby a powerful shield against US-led regime change.Were Pyongyang to surrender all that, it would almost certainly demand concessions so great \u2013 such as the end of the US\u2013South Korean alliance \u2013 that such a swap would be likely rejected.Worse, it is not even clear if we could achieve the \u201cI\u201d (irreversibility) in CVID. \u201cC\u201d (complete) and \u201cV\u201d (verifiable) would be hard enough.The complete removal of all nuclear materials from North Korea would be a hugely expensive and time-consuming process. Verifiability too would be a tremendous challenge given the scale of the Northern programme and inevitable widespread scepticism regarding North Korean compliance.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un provides guidance\u00a0on a nuclear weapons programme in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency\u00a0in Pyongyang on Sep 3, 2017. (File photo:\u00a0KCNA via REUTERS)\n                            \n\n                    \n                The US and others would likely demand many cameras, regular inspector visits, and a North Korean return to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and International Atomic Energy Agency.If that were not hard enough, irreversibility would be impossible without physically removing the human capital of the North Korean nuclear programme.Uranium mines could be destroyed, but what about the actual scientists and technicians? Would they all be given South Korean passports, or residence in the US or some third country? Without removing these people, the programme could be restarted at a later time.I and other delegates asked government representatives about this: If, given how hard CVID would be, there were plans for any less-than-CVID, or sub-CVID, outcomes in negotiations with North Korea. By my count, this question was never properly answered by any government attendee.At this point, this should not surprise us. South Korean, Japanese, and Western elites have painted themselves into a corner on CVID.Led by US President Donald Trump\u2019s triumphalism last month that North Korea was coming to Singapore to denuclearise, we have all talked up CVID so much that to pull back from it now, only a few days before Trump meets Kim, would smack of flinching.Nevertheless, governments must know, as the analyst community does, that North Korea is highly unlikely to accept complete, verifiable, irreversible disarmament.Indeed, Trump has started admitting that the summit with Kim will not, in fact, yield a major breakthrough.WHAT TO REALLY EXPECTThe hyping of CVID sets expectations far too high. It opens political space for hawks, most notably US National Security Advisor John Bolton, to push for kinetic options after the upcoming summit misses this all-or-nothing benchmark.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nNational Security Adviser John Bolton stands alongside US President Donald Trump as he speaks about the prospects for the summit with North Korea going ahead - the\u00a0meeting was put in doubt when Pyongyang bristled at comments made by Bolton.

Moon\u2019s promotion of North Korea as reformed is unlikely. Kim Jong-un was a vicious tyrant in his father\u2019s and grandfather\u2019s mould until he conveniently became a reformer this January after acquiring massive retaliatory capability against the US late in 2017.Similarly, CVID is unlikely. If we are going to deal with North Korea, let us engage the reality of an Orwellian tyranny which got to nukes by hook or crook and will demand an awful lot to give them up.We need to start thinking seriously about what we are willing to give up in exchange for what from the North Korean side. That debate, which needs to be conducted in public, has scarcely begun.Robert E Kelly is a professor of international relations in the Department of Political Science and Diplomacy at Pusan National University.

The two sides can listen to each other right here in this assembly.\"French President Emmanuel Macron used his speech to urge \"dialogue and multilateralism,\" crediting the 2015 accord with curbing Tehran's nuclear programme.Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, another ally whose relations with Trump have cooled, did not mention the US president by name but there was little doubt who he had in mind when he said it was \"very easy to create chaos but difficult to re-establish order.\"And South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said it was important to \"resist any and all efforts to undermine the mulilateral approach to international trade\" at a time when Trump is hoisting tariffs against a variety of trading partners.In his opening speech, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said trust in the rules-based global order and among states was \"at a breaking point\" and international cooperation was becoming more difficult, again without specifically mentioning Trump.\"Today, world order is increasingly chaotic,\" Guterres told the 193-nation assembly.TRUMP DENOUNCES 'GLOBALIST' VIEWTrump robustly attacked \"globalist\" views and vowed that \"America will never apologise for protecting its citizens.\"He said that the UN-backed International Criminal Court has \"no jurisdiction, no legitimacy and no authority.\"His administration -\u00a0which has recently choked off aid to the Palestinians -\u00a0will only support \"our friends\" in the future, he added.Boasting that his team \"has achieved more than any administration in the history of our country,\" Trump was met with laughter.\"I didn't expect that reaction, but that's okay,\" he responded.While he praised China's President Xi Jinping for his role in the North Korea peace process, Trump had harsh words for Beijing amid a growing trade war, saying the commercial imbalance with the Asian power \"cannot be tolerated.\"Venezuela's \"repressive regime\" was another target of Trump's invective, held responsible for a \"human tragedy\" in the once oil-rich nation.Trump then openly mused that Maduro \"could be toppled very quickly\" if his military chiefs turned on him.He also reserved harsh words for OPEC, the global oil cartel that includes both US allies and foes.\"OPEC and OPEC nations are, as usual, ripping off the rest of the world, and I don't like it. Nobody should like it.\""},

In the United States, the sharpness of President Trump\u2019s complaints that China is plundering American wealth have intensified as it has become clear that his tariffs will not reduce the trade deficit or deliver Chinese structural economic reforms \u2014 rather, they\u2019ll hurt farmers, factory workers, and small business owners.In China, amusement over President Trump\u2019s unconventional style has given way to anger that Trump is attempting to damage China\u2019s economy, derail China\u2019s rise, and delegitimise China\u2019s leadership. Many in Beijing also have complained that Trump is scapegoating China for America\u2019s own domestic challenges.According to this logic, Beijing has no incentive to accommodate President Trump\u2019s demands on trade or any other issue, because Beijing judges that doing so would not address the underlying motive of Trump\u2019s actions \u2014 to knock down America\u2019s nearest peer competitor.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementREAD:\u00a0China is running out of American products to target in a trade war, a commentaryCHANGED TONESThe tenor of the relationship changed in late September, though.First, the United States launched a fusillade of actions against many of China\u2019s most vulnerable points.\u00a0\n    AdvertisementThese actions included implementation of a US$200 billion unilateral tariff package, an arms sales announcement to Taiwan, a Congressional resolution on Tibet, public censure of China\u2019s repression of ethnic Uighur citizens in Xinjiang, publicised B-52 bomber operations in the South and East China Seas, the first sanctions on the People\u2019s Liberation Army since the Tiananmen incident in 1989, and the announcement of a new policy requiring America-based members of China\u2019s state media to register as foreign agents.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump addresses the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S., September 25, 2018.

At that event, and in subsequent public comments, President Trump accused China of interfering in America\u2019s electoral process.When pressed for evidence, President Trump thus far has only offered that Chinese media bought inserts in an Iowa newspaper and that China targeted its tariffs to hurt voters in electoral districts that previously supported Trump.While such actions by China are unwelcome and most likely counterproductive to China\u2019s goal of compelling Trump to lower the temperature on trade tensions, they are not unique.\u00a0Many countries routinely purchase inserts in newspapers and magazines, and many of America\u2019s closest friends similarly have imposed geographically targeted tariffs in retaliation to Trump\u2019s trade actions.So, from Beijing\u2019s perspective, by singling out China and accusing it of \u201cinterfering\u201d in America\u2019s election on the basis of actions that multiple other countries have taken, Trump may be setting the predicate for blaming China for expected electoral setbacks this November.READ:\u00a0China says it does not interfere in other countries' internal affairsMembers of the Trump administration may take their cue from the president in the coming weeks and build a public case that China is an enemy of the American people. There also may be further punitive measures against China.China almost certainly would counter-punch.

He no longer will be able to warn Xi privately of the risk of a rupture in relations if China takes actions that implicate vital US interests.\u00a0Trump also will not be able to count on the support of any ally anywhere in the world for pursuing a purely confrontational approach toward China.Even countries most wary of China \u2014 like Japan, India and Australia \u2014 will not risk economic ties with China. To the contrary, these countries have been hedging against American unreliability by working to stabilize relations with China.Instead, the policy tools President Trump will be left with include threats, penalties, public pressure, and the possibility of horizontal escalation \u2014 taking action on issues of importance to Beijing to induce pressure on China to capitulate to American demands.\u00a0If the relationship goes down this path, the present period of heightened tensions could become a way station to conflict.READ:\u00a0We may be in the early stages of a new Cold War, a commentaryFALSE CHOICESPresident Trump\u2019s supporters will argue that previous administrations\u2019 efforts to pursue a balance of cooperation and competition only served to enable China\u2019s rise, and therefore, Trump is justified in shaking things up and pursuing a more confrontational course.\u00a0Such logic rests on a false choice between maintaining the status quo versus racing headlong down a fruitlessly dangerous path.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nPresident Donald Trump did not go into details about how he believed China was interfering in the US midterms which could see the Republicans lose control of both houses of Congress AFP/Don EMMERT\n                            \n\n                    \n                The Trump administration is right to challenge unacceptable Chinese behaviour. China\u2019s efforts to discriminate against US firms, turn back the tide of economic reform, bully American allies and partners, improperly manipulate American public discourse, and violate the basic rights of its own citizens merit a forceful American response.Such a response will have more impact, though, if it is focused on specific concerns and embedded within a demonstrable effort to manage the world\u2019s most complex and consequential bilateral relationship, rather than as an element of a strategy to define China as an enemy.READ:\u00a0Fork in the road as brewing trade war hints at revision of US-China relations, a commentaryWashington also needs to find its friends around the world who share similar concerns about China\u2019s behavior, and who are willing to push back on specific issues that implicate their interests.\u00a0Beijing will feel more pressure to moderate its behavior at home and abroad if it faces a chorus of criticism from around the world than if it believes it needs to hunker down to fend off the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to undercut China\u2019s sociopolitical stability.The US-China relationship may be approaching an inflection point. The choices that leaders in Washington and Beijing make in the coming weeks may have a lasting effect on whether each side sees in the other a challenger and competitor with whom it remains possible to maintain generally stable relations, or an implacable foe that needs to be undermined.Ryan Hass is David M Rubenstein fellow for foreign policy at the Centre for East Asia Policy Studies and the John L Thornton China Centre at the Brookings Institution.\u00a0A version of this commentary first appeared in the Brookings Institution\u2019s blog Order from Chaos.

North Korean officials have yet to demonstrate that in working-level talks, the intelligence officials said.Some officials in the State and Defense Departments and in US\u00a0intelligence agencies are worried Trump has put himself at a disadvantage by overstating the results of the Singapore summit.Pompeo had said before Singapore Trump would reject anything short of \"complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation\".The State Department says pressure will remain until North Korea denuclearises but, in statements this week, it redefined the US\u00a0goal as \"the final, fully verified denuclearisation\" of the country.Some US\u00a0officials and experts have said the change in language amounted to a softening in approach. The State Department said its policy remains unchanged.Pompeo's talks will be closely watched in the region. He is due to meet officials from allies South Korea and Japan in Tokyo on Sunday."},

The \u201csceptical environmentalist\u201d, Bjorn Lomborg, has returned to warn against the excesses of an impending green dictatorship. The latest threat: Taking away our burgers!Yes, you\u2019ve heard correctly. According to Lomborg it could even go as far as the \u201cUN dictating what people eat\u201d.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementA well-known provocateur who now runs a think-tank in his native Denmark, Lomborg first made his name in the early 2000s with a series of outspoken but attention-grabbing attacks on mainstream environmentalism.\u00a0He argued that the climate is changing but less dramatically than most suggest, and that there is no urgent need for action. He also claimed that forests aren\u2019t disappearing and that species extinction has been wildly exaggerated.READ:\u00a0Think twice when considering banning beef, a commentary by Bjorn LomborgLomborg walks the line between sensible liberal thinking and outright denialism by cherry-picking or misrepresenting statistics. Though widely criticised by most scientists, Lomborg retains a large following today.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementThis is why his typically contrarian take on climate change and food attracts so much attention, and why it is worth responding to.Lomborg, a vegetarian for animal welfare reasons, explains that:\u00a0Almost all articles on this topic suggest going vegetarian could achieve emission cuts of 50 per cent\u00a0or more.\u00a0But apparently none of them have taken the time to \u201cdig deeper\u201d.\n    AdvertisementAs researchers who work in environmental impact analysis, we are acutely aware of the limitations of \u201cfood footprinting\u201d studies and the danger of taking figures at face value.So, let\u2019s dig deeper into his claims.ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN OF EATING MEATTake the \u201csystematic peer review\u201d he cites which found that going vegetarian cuts personal emissions by around 5 per cent\u00a0rather than 50 per cent. He\u2019s correct that the cuts aren\u2019t close to halving a person\u2019s overall emissions, but there is good reason to believe it is double what Lomborg claims.Only two studies in the review he uses look at the major effect of meat consumption on emissions from deforestation, even though millions of hectares of forest are cleared each year to satisfy the world\u2019s appetite for beef.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nDeforestation -\u00a0responsible for about a fifth of greenhouse gas emissions - intensifies global warming. (Photo: AFP/Chaider Mahyuddin)\n                            \n\n                    \n                As forests act as a carbon sink, while beef farms emit lots of greenhouse gases, this has a huge impact on net emissions.\u00a0Meat consumption is incompatible with limiting deforestation and encroachment into natural land. Hence, we must take into account \u201cdeforestation emissions\u201d when tallying the environmental burden of eating meat.IMPACT OF COLLECTIVE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONSTaking the more realistic figure from these studies we arrive at a 10 per cent\u00a0cut in personal emissions from going vegetarian. To put this into context: A\u00a0shift to vegetarianism in the UK would be the equivalent of taking 8 million\u00a0(or one in four) cars off the country\u2019s roads.\u00a0The impacts of veganism would be greater still. In short, the impact of individual actions really does add up.What about Lomborg\u2019s second claim that vegetarians take the money they save from \u201ceating carrots instead of steak\u201d and spend it on other things which have their own environmental impact, offsetting part of the benefits of giving up meat?We dug deeper and found that the paper he cites relies on data from 2006 and also does not factor in emissions from changing land use, linked to deforestation.\u00a0The paper is a microeconomic analysis of what consumers in Sweden, specifically, might spend their extra cash on if they went vegetarian.\u00a0Its author warns that her work must be \u201cinterpreted within a relatively narrow topical and temporal scope\u201d, and that unrealistic market assumptions concerning fixed supply, demand, and pricing could lead to completely different conclusions when relaxed.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nBjorn Lomborg claims that the 50 per cent reduction in emissions can only be achieved by going a lot further than vegetarianism (Photo: Unsplash/Roosa Kulju)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Nevertheless, Lomborg does extrapolate the paper\u2019s findings, against its author\u2019s own suggestion, to trivialise the impact of vegetarianism on emissions across the industrialised world.PLANT-BASED DIET ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTClearly, this is not just about the environment. It\u2019s about our ability to choose.\u00a0Lomborg prioritises the right to eat meat over our collective responsibility not to.\u00a0Many of the world\u2019s poorest are involuntary vegetarians, he argues. Our duty, he implies, is to support their \u201cright to meat\u201d.\u00a0However, poorer countries stand to benefit from widescale adoption of a plant-based diet. Mortality linked to strokes, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer could fall by 5\u00a0million to 6 million\u00a0avoided deaths and trillions of dollars could be saved in healthcare costs and by preventing productivity losses.READ:\u00a0Add more plants, and less meat to your meals. Here\u2019s why. A commentaryMoreover, producing meat is terribly inefficient as animals consume far more food than they yield. If we grew crops for human consumption, instead of animal feed, we could increase available food calories by as much as 70 per cent, which could feed an additional 4 billion people, ending global hunger and reducing emissions, one carrot at a time.CLIMATE DENIALLomborg summarises his argument:\u00a0Climate change is both trivialised and hampered by unrealistic senses of magnitude, and by silly suggestions that your or my actions can transform the planet.To suggest you and I can do nothing to help prevent climate change is surely defeatist. This climate defeatism is the new climate denial.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nA woman walks past a map showing the elevation of the sea in the last 22 years during the World Climate Change Conference 2015 (COP21) at Le Bourget, near Paris, France, December 11, 2015.

Although he knows consumers will fry the planet before they do lab-grown burgers, prescribing artificial meat helps kick the can further down the road.Although we need systemic change, the climate is also in our hands.

And the cycle begins again.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementThe Danish use the word hygge to describe the feeling of cosyness, warmth, and comfort that a well-kept house is supposed to provide. Yet creating this pleasant environment requires work and, unfortunately, the bulk of that work is done by women.Findings from a survey of households in Australia show men have increased their housework time by 55 minutes and women have reduced theirs by two-and-a-half hours per week. So the gender gap in housework is narrowing.Yet women still do seven hours more housework per week than men. Do women just have a love of cleaning that men do not share? Or are men \u201cdirt-blind\u201d \u2013 unable to see the mess as it emerges and takes over the sofa?Fortunately for humankind, the answer to both of these questions is no and there are solutions to tidy up this gendered mess.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementREAD: Denmark reveals the secret to being one of the world\u2019s happiest countries, a commentaryWOMEN ARE PENALISED FOR A DIRTY, MESSY HOMEWhile attitudes towards gender roles have become less traditional, there are still gendered expectations about the cleanliness of the home and children.Any dirt, mess or failure to provide clean, immaculately dressed and polite children to the world is most often a judgement against women \u2013 a sure sign of bad mothering. Inherent in this assumption is the idea that men don\u2019t see mess, or are oblivious to the cleaning and mental work associated with ensuring that the household runs properly.\n    AdvertisementEven when housework is outsourced, women are more often responsible for organising and paying the cleaner, or hitting the button on the full dishwasher or robot vacuum.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n(Photo: Unsplash/The Creative Exchange)\n                            \n\n                    \n                What\u2019s more, the types of domestic work that are outsourced is usually the work often done by men, such as gardening or household maintenance. So the benefit of domestic outsourcing is usually marginal for women.Because of men\u2019s lack of desire to twirl a brush around the toilet bowl, or their general lack of concern about having a clean house, we tend to think of them as being \u201cdirt-blind\u201d. But really it\u2019s because men aren\u2019t penalised for messiness in the same way that women are.For women, cleanliness in the family home is a further extension of prevailing social norms dictating that women must be clean, hairless, perfumed and pretty. In this regard, doing housework is a way for women to \u201cperform\u201d their gender.Men not doing housework also fits with long-held ideas about men and dirt that begin with boys and the outdoors. Thus, housekeeping is as much about gendered expectations as it is about actual dirt. Men do see dirt, but they aren\u2019t told from a young age that leaving a mess makes them bad men.EQUAL EARNERS SHARE EQUAL HOUSEWORKIn 2017, Australian women earned 87 cents for every dollar earned by a man. The gender pay gap in Australia has hovered between 15 to 19 per cent for the past two decades.Mothers, regardless of their profession, earn less than fathers, indicating that gender-based reasons, rather than competence or occupational type, explains these gaps.The gap in earnings is important, as having more money gives women more power \u2013 including to outsource housework. Studies show that women are more likely than men to use their earnings to outsource housework.Women who are equal earners to men report the most equal housework divisions.Yet when women start to earn more than their husbands, their earnings are less effective than men\u2019s in getting their husbands to increase their housework share. Housework scholarship has long documented that women who earn more than their male partners spend more, not less, time in housework than women whose earnings equal men\u2019s.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA mother feeding her baby at home.

A commentaryCLOSING THE HOUSEWORK GAPA recent study about housework posed a dire warning. At the current pace, it will take 30 years for the gender gap in housework to close. But this is unlikely to happen unless we rethink the way men and women organise their work and family lives.There are a few ways forward. First, governments can provide help, in the form of subsidies to hire cleaners or buy prepared meals, to help families reduce their housework burden.The Swedes have instituted a tax credit for housework to help reduce the family\u2019s load and to bring this type of black-market labour into the light.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA couple preparing dinner in the kitchen. (Photo: Unsplash/Soroush Karimi)\n                            \n\n                    \n                The second is for women to reduce their housework to similar levels as men. Based on current estimates, this means women will contribute 55 minutes per week.We could call this a housework strike \u2013 a way to draw attention to the unseen housework that women do and to encourage men\u2019s equal contribution. This will require women to become \u201cdirt blind\u201d and hold out until a crisis point is reached, such as everyone in the house running out of clean underwear.However, women still do more childcare than men, so this won\u2019t solve all of women\u2019s domestic woes. The final solution is for men to see housework for what it is \u2013 drudgery that we all have to do in order to achieve hygge.Men have heeded the call to increase their time with children \u2013 now a housework revolution is necessary for us all to relax.Leah Ruppanner is senior lecturer in sociology at the University of Melbourne.

We are continuing to watch developments carefully.\"Trump had earlier indicated the summit could be salvaged after welcoming a conciliatory statement from North Korea saying it remained open to talks.\"It was a very nice statement they put out,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"We'll see what happens - it could even be the 12th.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\"We're talking to them now. They very much want to do it. We'd like to do it.\"After years of tension over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, Kim and Trump agreed this month to hold what would be the first meeting between a serving US president and a North Korean leader. The plan followed months of war threats and insults between the leaders over North Korea's development of missiles capable of reaching the United States.Trump scrapped the meeting, planned for Singapore, in a letter to Kim on Thursday after repeated threats by North Korea to pull out over what it saw as confrontational remarks by US officials demanding unilateral disarmament. Trump cited North Korean hostility in cancelling the summit.\n    AdvertisementIn Pyongyang, North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan said North Korea's criticisms had been a reaction to American rhetoric and that current antagonism showed \"the urgent necessity\" for the summit.He said North Korea regretted Trump's decision to cancel and remained open to resolving issues \"regardless of ways, at any time.\"Kim Kye Gwan said North Korea had appreciated Trump having made the bold decision to work toward a summit.\"We even inwardly hoped that what is called 'Trump formula' would help clear both sides of their worries and comply with the requirements of our side and would be a wise way of substantial effect for settling the issue,\" he said.DIPLOMATS AT WORKTrump's latest about-face sent officials scrambling in Washington. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters diplomats were \"still at work\" and said Trump had just sent a note out on the summit, which could be back on \"if our diplomats can pull it off\".US State Department spokeswoman Katina Adams declined to give details of any diplomatic contacts but said: \"As the president said in his letter to Chairman Kim, dialogue between the two is the only dialogue that matters. If North Korea is serious, then we look forward hearing from them at the highest levels.\"White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters Trump did not want a meeting that was \"just a political stunt\".\"He wants to get something that\u2019s a long-lasting and an actual real solution. And if they are they are ready to do that then ... we\u2019re certainly ready to have those conversations,\" she said.\"If the meeting takes place on June 12, we'll be ready, if it takes place on July 12, we will be ready.\"Sanders indicated it had yet to be decided whether White House officials would stick to a plan to travel to Singapore in coming days to prepare the summit.North Korea had sharply criticised suggestions by Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, and Vice President Mike Pence that it could share the fate of Libya if it did not swiftly surrender its nuclear arsenal. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed by NATO-backed militants after halting his nascent nuclear program.\"TRUMP FORMULA\"Trump had initially sought to placate North Korea, saying he was not pursuing the \"Libya model\" and Sanders said he was following \"the President Trump model.\"US\u00a0regional allies Japan and South Korea, as well as North Korea's main ally, China, urged the two countries to salvage the summit on Friday.At an economic forum in St. Petersburg, Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan said it was necessary to ensure security on the Korean peninsula, which touched on China's core interests.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, at the same forum, regretted the cancellation and said the world should keep doing its bit to make the summit happen.South Korea also would continue efforts to improve ties with the North, the office of President Moon Jae-in said after Moon's top security advisers met for the second time on Friday.Some analysts worried that cancelling the summit could prompt a resumption in hostilities, including renewed shorter-range missile tests or stepped-up cyber attacks by Pyongyang and increased sanctions or deployment of new military assets by Washington.In his letter, Trump warned Kim of the United States' greater nuclear might, reminiscent of his tweet last year asserting that he had a \"much bigger\" nuclear button than Kim.While the Trump administration had insisted on North Korea's complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of its nuclear program, Pyongyang had always couched its language in terms of denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.It has said in previous, failed talks that it could consider giving up its arsenal if the United States provided security guarantees by removing its troops from South Korea and withdrawing its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from South Korea and Japan."},

We talked about a lot,\" said Trump.\"It went very well. It's really a get-to-know-you kind of a situation.\"Kim's White House visit was not on the official presidential schedule, but had been rumored for days.Then, shortly after midday, a small group of White House pool reporters received a cryptic email to meet at a designated point for an unspecified reason in seven minutes.If allowing coverage of Kim's arrival was designed to send a signal, so too was the decision about who participated for the US side.As Kim arrived, peering through a nearby glass door, was the familiar silvery mustache of John Bolton, Trump's hawkish national security advisor.Having offended North Korea with comments that hinted at regime change, he largely stayed away from the cameras and stayed out of the Oval meeting, aides said.A White House official cautioned against reading too much into Bolton's absence, but you can be certain Pyongyang got the message: Trump wants to play nice.The president underscored that message again and again, when he was asked whether his campaign of \"maximum pressure,\" which included sanctions and threats of annihilation, was over.\"I don't even want to use the term 'maximum pressure' anymore because I don't want to use that term because we're getting along,\" Trump said. \"You see the relationship. We're getting along.\"\"We had hundreds of new sanctions ready to go on,\" he added. \"I'm not going to put them on until such time as the talks break down.\"Trump even admitted that he had not raised the issue of human rights, as he said he was looking forward to the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un.But as he stood side-by-side smiling with Kim Yong Chol outside the Oval Office, before waving him goodbye, there was a small but poignant reminder of the scale of Trump's task.On Kim's chest, just in front of his heart, sat a red flag pin featuring images of Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung, the previous two leaders of the Kim dynasty and the current leader's father and grandfather.One started North Korea's nuclear program, the other refused to give it up.Trump is betting he can make a deal and that North Korea's current ruler will break with decades old family tradition. Friday's meeting showed he is willing to stake America's reputation on it."},

Since then, there have been occasional clashes on the divided peninsula.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\"We talked about it.

We never were. I told him today, 'Take your time',\" he said, adding nevertheless that he expects \"a really positive result in the end.\"Kim Yong Chol, vice chairman of the ruling party executive and the most senior North Korean to visit the United States in 18 years, spent almost 90 minutes in the Oval Office.Afterwards, Trump and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo walked the North's small delegation to their waiting cars, smiling and shaking hands in front of the media before the motorcade pulled away.SECURITY GUARANTEESNorth Korean officials said Kim Yong Chol was expected to return to Pyongyang shortly. Meanwhile, discussions between US and North Korean officials continue in Singapore and in the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea.On Thursday, Kim Jong Un told Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that his commitment to denuclearization remains \"unchanged and consistent and fixed,\" but experts warn he will seek concessions from Washington.In addition to an end to the war, he is likely to seek international recognition as well as guarantees against any strike by the US forces stationed in South Korea.As expected, Kim Yong Chol handed Trump a letter from Kim that may clear up some of the questions. The US leader said the missive was \"very nice\" - but then admitted he had not yet read it. An aide later confirmed he did after the talks.The Oval Office talks and letter delivery came only a week after Trump threatened to consign the entire process to history, abruptly cancelling the summit in a sharply worded letter, only to revive preparations shortly afterwards.Trump said that, after Friday's talks, the parties are \"totally over that and now we're going to deal and we're going to really start a process.\"Since the short-lived boycott threat, diplomats from both countries have conducted an intense flurry of talks, culminating this week when Pompeo sat down in New York with Kim's envoy.'THEIR DECISION'Pompeo said on Thursday that, after what have now been two meetings with Kim Jong Un and three with Kim Yong Chol, he believes the North is at least ready to consider addressing US demands for denuclearization.\"I believe they are contemplating a path forward. They can make a strategic shift. One that their country has not been prepared to make before. This will obviously be their decision,\" he said.The flurry of diplomacy has also seen a rapprochement on the Korean peninsula, with the two Koreas holding high-level talks Friday at the border truce village of Panmunjom.The meeting followed two landmark summits between the leaders of North and South Korea in the last five weeks.North and South Korea agreed to hold more meetings throughout this month to carry out the agreements reached between their leaders at the April summit, according to a joint statement issued after Friday's talks."},

When you look beyond the headlines, those arguing for banishing meat-eaters from restaurants and calling on everyone to change their diets are often cherry-picking the data while ignoring basic facts.Reading the popular press on this topic, you find plenty of articles suggesting that eliminating meat consumption could cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 50 per cent or more. That\u2019s massive. It\u2019s also massively misleading.\n    AdvertisementImportantly, the 50 per cent reduction in emissions is achieved by going a lot further than vegetarianism. It requires going completely vegan, which means stopping eating and using any animal products: Milk, eggs, honey, meat, poultry, seafood, fur, leather, wool, gelatin, and much else. This is not going to be a mainstream dietary and lifestyle regime any time soon.Still, the media suggest that going vegetarian can achieve a reduction of 20 to 35 per cent\u00a0in an individual\u2019s personal emissions. But these are not a person\u2019s entire emissions \u2013 they are those emitted just from food.\u00a0Four-fifths of emissions are ignored, which means the impact is actually five times lower.OVERSTATED EFFECTSIf we turn to the academic literature on emission cuts from going vegetarian, a systematic survey of peer-reviewed studies shows that a non-meat diet will likely reduce an individual\u2019s emissions by the equivalent of 540kg of CO2.For the average person in the industrialised world, that means cutting emissions by just 4.3 per cent.But this still overstates the effect, because it ignores an age-old and well-described economic phenomenon known as the \u201crebound effect\".\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nAt current levels of greenhouse gas emissions, the IPCC report finds with \"high confidence\", we will zoom past the 1.5C marker around 2040 (Photo: AFP/SPENCER PLATT)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Vegetarian diets are slightly cheaper, and saved money will be spent on other goods and services that cause additional greenhouse-gas emissions.\u00a0In the United States, vegetarians save about 7 per cent, and in the United Kingdom 15 per cent of their food budgets. A Swedish study shows a vegetarian diet is 10 per cent cheaper, freeing up about 2 per cent of an individual\u2019s total budget.\u00a0That extra spending will cause more CO2 emissions, which the study concludes will cancel out half the saved emissions from going vegetarian.In a developed-country setting, the reality is that going entirely vegetarian for the rest of your life means reducing your emissions by about 2 per cent.This is a well-established result, but it still surprises many people who believe that becoming vegetarian should achieve more.\u00a0Indeed, when I first highlighted these figures, two British researchers attacked my approach and even claimed that I must be \u201ccherry-picking.\u201d\u00a0But the figure is the best estimate of a meta-study, not the result of choosing a single study with the highest or lowest impact.CHERRY PICKINGIn contrast, to bolster their counter-argument that vegetarianism has a much higher impact, the academics chose to rely on only two studies that just happened to have two of the highest estimates.\u00a0Then they disregarded the one showing a lower effect and rounded up the figure given by the other.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nBjorn Lomborg claims that the 50 per cent reduction in emissions can only be achieved by going a lot further than vegetarianism (Photo: Unsplash/Roosa Kulju)\n                            \n\n                    \n                They even ignored the rebound effect, which halves the real-world impact, although the literature clearly says \u201cwhen evaluating the environmental consequences of vegetarianism the rebound effect of the savings should be taken into account\".Of course, fiddling with numbers to fit our preconceptions doesn\u2019t fool the planet. The fact is, instead of going completely vegetarian for the rest of your life, you could reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by the exact same amount by spending US$6 a year using the European emissions trading system \u2013 while eating anything you want.INCONVENIENT TRUTHAn emissions cut of a couple of percentage points is nothing to sneer at, but it is certainly not what will \u201csave the planet\".The inconvenient truth is that few individual actions can transform the battle against climate change.\u00a0One action that could make a genuine difference is campaigning for far more spending on global investment in green-energy research and development.\u00a0This technology needs to be massively developed if we are ever to bring forward the day when alternatives can outcompete fossil fuels.More research and development also is needed to reduce the carbon impact of farming, as well as to develop and produce at scale artificial meat, which could cut greenhouse-gas emissions by up to 96 per cent, relative to conventionally produced meat.Like much campaigning, Figueres\u2019s plan for meat-eaters is disturbing, because it suggests that the former UN climate chief is focused on banning behaviour she doesn\u2019t like, based on flimsy evidence and over-the-top newspaper reporting.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA meat deli in Copenhagen, Denmark (Photo: Unsplash/Nick Karvounis)\n                            \n\n                    \n                It also suggests a narrow focus on the world\u2019s rich.

Even if the company\u2019s engineers and researchers can figure out how to sort it all, there are physical limitations to how useful the collected plastic will be.The act of recycling involves grinding up materials into very small pieces before melting and reforming them. An inescapable part of that process is that every time plastic is recycled, its polymers \u2013 the long chemical sequences that provide its structure \u2013 become shorter.Generally speaking, lighter and more flexible types of plastic can only be recycled into denser, harder materials \u2013 unless large amounts of new virgin plastic are added to the mixture.\u00a0After one or two rounds of recycling, the possibilities for reuse become very limited. At that point, the \u201cdowncycled\u201d plastic material is formed into textiles, car bumpers or plastic lumber, none of which end up anywhere else but the landfill.

Most bacteria can\u2019t degrade plastics because the polymers contain strong carbon-to-carbon chemical bonds that are different from anything bacteria evolved alongside in nature.\u00a0Fortunately, after being in the environment with human-discarded plastics for a number of decades, bacteria seem to be evolving to use this synthetic feedstock that pervades modern life.In 2016, a team of biologists and materials scientists found a bacterium that can\u00a0eat the particular type of plastic used in beverage bottles. The bacteria turns PET plastic into more basic substances that can be\u00a0remade into virgin plastics.\u00a0After identifying the key enzyme in the bacteria\u2019s plastic-digestion process, the research team went on to deliberately engineer the enzyme to make it more effective.

Evolution isn\u2019t always quick. The findings suggest the possibility of discovering additional enzymes that work with other plastics. But they also raise the possibility of taking matters into our own hands and designing new enzymes and microbes.Already, completely artificial proteins coded by synthetically constructed genes are acting like artificial enzymes and\u00a0catalysing reactions in cells.\u00a0One researcher claims:We can develop proteins\u00a0\u2013 that would normally have taken billions of years to evolve \u2013 in a matter of months.In other labs, synthetic genomes built entirely out of bottles of chemicals are now\u00a0capable of running bacterial cells. Entirely synthetic cells \u2013 genomes, metabolic processes, functional cellular structures and all \u2013 are thought to be only\u00a0a decade away.This coming era of synthetic biology not only promises to change what organisms can do. It threatens to change what organisms actually are.\u00a0Bacteria will no longer just be naturally occurring life forms; some, even many, of them will be purpose-built microbes constructed expressly to provide functions useful to humans, such as composting plastic.

But when it comes to happiness, a general consensus seems to have emerged.Depending on the scope and purpose of the research, happiness is often measured using objective indicators (data on crime, income, civic engagement and health) and subjective methods, such as asking people how frequently they experience positive and negative emotions.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementWhy might Danes evaluate their lives more positively? As a psychologist and native of Denmark, I\u2019ve looked into this question.Yes, Danes have a stable government, low levels of public corruption, and access to high-quality education and health care.\u00a0The country does have the the highest taxes in the world, but the vast majority of Danes happily pay: They believe higher taxes can create a better society.Perhaps most importantly, however, they value a cultural construct called \u201chygge\u201d.\n    AdvertisementHIGH-QUALITY SOCIAL INTERACTIONSThe Oxford dictionary added the word in June 2017. Hygge refers to high-quality social interactions. Hygge can be used as a noun, adjective or verb (to hygge oneself), and events and places can also be hyggelige (hygge-like).Hygge is sometimes translated as \u201ccozy,\u201d but a better definition of hygge is \u201cintentional intimacy,\u201d which can happen when you have safe, balanced and harmonious shared experiences. A cup of coffee with a friend in front of a fireplace might qualify, as could a summer picnic in the park.A family might have a hygge evening that entails board games and treats, or friends might get together for a casual dinner with dimmed lighting, good food and easygoing fun.Spaces can also be described as hyggelige (\u201cYour new house is so hyggeligt\u201d) and a common way of telling a host thank you after a dinner is to say that it was hyggeligt (meaning, we had a good time).\u00a0Most Danish social events are expected to be hyggelige, so it would be a harsh critique to say that a party or dinner wasn\u2019t hyggelige.A BUFFER AGAINST STRESSResearch on hygge has found that in Denmark, it\u2019s integral to people\u2019s sense of well-being. It acts as a buffer against stress, while also creating a space to build camaraderie. In a highly individualised country like Denmark, hygge can promote egalitarianism and strengthen trust.It would be fair to say that hygge is fully integrated into the Danish cultural psyche and culture.\u00a0But it has also become a bit of a global phenomenon \u2013 Amazon now sells more than 900 books on hygge, and Instagram has over 3 million posts with the hashtag #hygge. Google trends data show a big jump in searches for hygge beginning in October 2016.Nor is Denmark the only country that has a word for a concept similar to hygge \u2013 the Norwegians have koselig, the Swedes mysig, the Dutch gezenlligheid and the Germans gem\u00fctlichkeit.In the US \u2013 which also places a high value on individualism \u2013 there\u2019s no real cultural equivalent of hygge.\u00a0There, income is generally associated with happiness; yet even though the country\u2019s GDP has been rising and its unemployment rates have been declining, levels of happiness in the US have been steadily decreasing.What\u2019s going on?Income inequality continues to be an issue in the US. But there\u2019s also been a marked decrease in interpersonal trust and trust toward institutions like the government as well as the media.\u00a0In the end, more disposable income doesn\u2019t hold a candle to having someone to rely on in a time of need (something that 95 per cent of Danes believe they have).At its core, hygge is about building intimacy and trust with others.We all could probably use a little more of it in our lives.Marie Helweg-Larsen is professor of psychology at Dickinson College.

He urged Trump and Kim to talk directly.Pyongyang had not responded in recent days to queries by the United States as it tried to prepare logistics for a June 12 leaders' summit, US\u00a0Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a Senate hearing.Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said Tokyo understands Trump\u2019s decision to cancel the Singapore summit, Kyodo News reported.\u201cIt\u2019s meaningless to have talks that don\u2019t achieve results,\u201d Kono told reporters on a visit to Mexico City, the news agency said.The news of the cancelled summit prompted a deluge of derisory comments on Twitter, including many about the now discounted commemorative coin pre-minted for the occasion.The \"President Trump United States and Korea Summit\" coin, which was the \"deal of the day\" at the White House Gift Shop on Thursday, shows gold embossed images of Trump and Kim facing each other with a montage of their countries' flags in the background. Kim's title is designated as \"Supreme Leader\"."},

Nobody should be anxious. We have to get it right.\"\"If and when Kim Jong Un chooses to engage in constructive dialogue and actions, I am waiting,\" he added.Foreign leaders reacted with dismay to the summit collapse, with South Korean President Moon Jae-in expressing \"deep regret\" and summoning top security aides for emergency talks.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the parties to keep talking, as did host Singapore, while Russia's President Vladimir Putin held out hope that dialogue would resume and the talks would eventually take place.'PROMISE WAS BROKEN'Politically, Trump had invested heavily in the success of the planned summit. Privately, most US officials, as well as outside observers, believed it would go ahead despite the recent uptick in tensions.But as the date drew nearer, the gulf in expectations between the two sides became apparent.Washington has made it clear it wants to see the \"complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation\" of the North.But Pyongyang has vowed it will never give up its nuclear deterrence until it feels safe from what it terms US aggression.Meanwhile, a senior White House official said Pyongyang had demonstrated a \"profound lack of good faith\" in the run-up to the summit -\u00a0including standing up the White House's deputy chief of staff, who had travelled to Singapore for preparatory talks.\"They waited and they waited. The North Koreans never showed up. The North Koreans did not tell us anything -\u00a0they simply stood us up,\" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.The White House viewed North Korea's objection to a routine US-South Korean joint military exercise -\u00a0and its recent cancellation of a meeting with the South Koreans -\u00a0as a breach of its commitments leading up to the summit.It also was unhappy about the North's failure to allow international observers to verify the dismantling of its Punggye-ri test site, the staging ground for all six of its nuclear tests which was buried inside a mountain near the border with China.\"That promise was broken,\" the White House official said.While a small group of journalists invited to the site described a series of explosions throughout the day, the official stressed that \"we will not have forensic evidence that much was accomplished.\"\"We certainly hope that it's the case but really don't know.\"'ROCKING AND READY'Abraham Denmark, director of the Asia programme at the Wilson Centre think tank, warned of the knock-on effects cancelling the meeting could have.\"South Korea is also likely to be angered, and the Alliance will take a hit.

In his 2018 SOTU, President Trump outlined a plan for immigration reform, but the resulting 2018 bill on border security and immigration failed passage in the House in June.\u00a0In a Republican-controlled Congress, the president was unable to secure passage for a bill concerning his signature policy issue, and now the Democrats have control of the House of Representatives.Given his strong and unrelenting focus on immigration and wall-building in his address, Trump seems to have chosen the potential deal on government funding and the wall as the cause with which to prove he can and will win. \u00a0\n    AdvertisementWith this renewed and high-profile emphasis on immigration and the wall, the President has already shifted into 2020 campaign mode, with much of the speech aimed at re-energising his base.\u00a0His conjuring up of an image of American military and technological might in World War II and the Cold War by honouring D-day veterans and the second man to walk on the moon astronaut Buzz Aldrin was aimed at rallying this group.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nPresident Donald Trump delivers the State of the Union address in the chamber of the US House of Representatives AFP/WIN MCNAMEE\n                            \n\n                    \n                Although Trump repeatedly called for non-partisanship, the reality is that partisan differences on foreign policy will only increase as Democratic primary candidates navigate their foreign policy platforms, which may result in heightened partisan contention in the short term.\u00a0Even republicans in Congress privately expressed discontent as the President derides the US intelligence community and refuses to listen or even discuss major policy decisions with military leaders, such as troop drawdowns in Syria and Afghanistan.REVERSING DECADES OF CALAMITOUS TRADE POLICIESSo it is no surprise Trump framed his mention of China in the context of America winning to become the \u201chottest economy anywhere in the world\u201c, with the creation of 5.3 million jobs, more people working than at any time in US history and with the fastest rising wages in decades \u2013 amid his efforts to reverse decades past administrations\u2019 \u201ccalamitous trade policies\u201d.Trump said his administration has made clear to the Chinese that after years of China\u2019s targeting American industries, and stealing\u00a0intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.READ:\u00a0Huawei charges are killing prospects of a US-China trade deal, a commentaryHe highlighted the imposed tariffs on US$250 billion of Chinese goods, suggested the US Treasury\u00a0\"is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime\u201d and pointed to an increase in federal tariff revenues as a bonus for the nation.But is that really so? The New York Times fact checker put this increase at US$13 billion by the third quarter of 2018 - a number that can also be interpreted as the unnecessary premium paid by US consumers as producers pass on the higher cost of imports.In addition, he referred to \u201canother historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA\u201d and said the new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement would bring back manufacturing jobs, expand US agriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure more cars are made in America.He also called for passage of the US Reciprocal Trade Act, which if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, would allow the US to charge the other country the same exact tariff on the same product they sell.No doubt trade will remain a hot-button issue from now until the 2020 presidential election, and any trade negotiation will come under huge scrutiny.READ: Huawei charges are killing prospects of a US-China trade deal, a commentaryCHINA TRADE ON OUR MINDS BUT NOT ON THE PRESIDENT\u2019S With less than a month before the \u201ctrade truce\u201d between the US and China is slated to end, Trump had to mention the ongoing negotiations between the two countries in his address.His remarks mirrored talking points of the US negotiating team, but the commitments the US is looking for from China that he articulates are very different: A new trade deal with China must \u201cinclude real structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce the trade deficit, and protect American jobs.\u201dThis is a tall order, and to fill it would require much work to do before Mar\u00a01, not to mention the uncertainty over whether these deep structural changes from China can be enacted so soon even if the Chinese government agrees.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day trade-tariff truce, due to expire on March 1.

Trump did not elaborate on the significance of this announcement, and he didn\u2019t need to.A year ago, Trump\u2019s foreign policy language in his State of the Union addressed featured strong messaging on North Korea, which he personalised by telling the story of a North Korean defector. The message was overwhelmingly one of freedom and triumph over evil.READ: A\u00a0tale of one North Korea defector and hopes for peace on the peninsula, a commentaryThe Trump administration turned this message on its head soon after with engagement of the Kim regime, which reached its peak in June of that year with the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore.Today, with his second summit with Kim confirmed for this month in Vietnam, Trump and his administration have undoubtedly reduced tensions between North Korea\u00a0and the region. However, the issue of denuclearisation and countless hours of hard work still stand between Trump and a \u201cwin,\u201d regardless of the number of summits his administration convenes.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un and United States President Donald Trump.

Two historic meetings with North Korea under his belt is something no other US president can claim.FOCUS ON 2020 ELECTIONSOverall, Trump\u2019s State of the Union had, expectedly, a domestic focus, with the only specific mentions of Asia being his trip to Vietnam and to China.Trump has been keen to portray himself as the only one who can resolve the nuclear crisis with North Korea, or rebalance the US\u2019 trade relationship with China by reducing cyber theft, forced technology transfer, and negotiate fundamental structural reform to ease the ever increasing deficit.Because he heavily campaigned on how the foreigners were taking advantage of America, Trump will be keen in the lead-up to the 2020 election to take actions that portray his administration as the only one willing to stand up for American jobs and level the playing field in a bid to live up to his America First policy.Tami Overby is a Senior Director at McLarty Associates and former SVP of Asia for the US Chamber of Commerce.

This month, it has been in the 90s.Why so popular with his base?Part of that is the country\u2019s economic performance.Beyond the economy, whether one likes it, credit must be given to the Trump administration for doing much of what it said it would do.READ:\u00a0Donald Trump, a truly historic president, a commentarySince January 2017, this Administration has achieved a great deal: From changing the dynamics of global trade to significantly reducing government regulations to changing policy and enforcement on immigration.BUT LOOK AT OVERALL APPROVAL RATINGSWith the state of the economy and this track record, one could expect Republican and independent voters to vote the same as they did two years ago which gave Republicans a 23-seat advantage in the 435 member House of Representatives.Not the case.What matters most in a mid-term election is the President\u2019s overall approval rating among all voters. A strong economy is not enough to get the President approval of more than a majority of Americans.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nSupporters cheer as US President Donald Trump addresses a campaign-style rally in Nashville, Tennessee on May 29, 2018 -- one of several he aims to hold ahead of November's mid-term elections (Photo: AFP/Nicholas Kamm)\n                            \n\n                    \n                \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bGoing back to 1978, when possible, no President with an approval rating below 50 per cent has been able to keep their party in control of both the House and Senate.Per a Gallup poll, President Trump\u2019s overall approval rating mid-October was 44 per cent, just one point off his all-time high.This approval rating will lead to Americans voting for divided government.WAVE ELECTIONSUS voters do not want the country to tack too far too the right or too far to the left. So, we usually switch Presidents from one party to the next.In the post-World War II era, only once has the same party occupied the White House for more than two terms, President Reagan from 1981 to 1989 and President George H W Bush from 1989 to 1993.Even more so, the President\u2019s own party often loses seats in Congress during mid-term elections as a way to keep his power in check.Often, a \u201cwave\u201d wipes out the President\u2019s party from Congress during these elections.Wave elections are when a political party makes major gains. There is no precise number of seats which need to be picked-up for an election to be defined as a wave. Typically, it will be enough when a party takes control of the House or Senate from the other party.Of the past six mid-term elections spanning 1994 to 2014, four were wave elections.\u00a0In 1994, the Republicans gained control of both chambers following Bill Clinton\u2019s election to office.In 2006, it was the Democrats turn, reclaiming both.Four years later, the Republicans won an astounding 63 seats in the House and 6 in the Senate.Then, in the last mid-term election, the second under President Obama, the Republicans increased their margins winning an additional 13 seats in the House and 9 in the Senate.ON THE WRONG TRACKSince the turn of this century, polls show Americans believe the country is on the \u201cwrong-track\u201d. As such, they blame whichever party is in power, giving each a short time to control the Congress \u2013 especially when one party controls the White House, House and Senate.There were two exceptions.In 1998, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives prepared to impeach President Clinton in the run-up to the elections.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nBill Clinton was sworn in as US President on January 20, 1993 (Photo: AFP/TIMOTHY A. CLARY)\n                            \n\n                    \n                For the first mid-term election since 1934, a non-presidential party failed to gain congressional seats. It was also the first time since 1822 that the non-presidential party failed to gain seats in the mid-term election of a President's second term.In 1998, despite the scandal surrounding Monica Lewinsky, President Clinton remained popular with voters \u2013 with a whopping 66 per cent approval rating. In hindsight, the voters punished the Republicans for preparing to impeach President Clinton.For the 2002 mid-terms, held in the aftermath of 9/11, the country continued to rally around President George W Bush and his response to the terror attacks.\u00a0His approval rating was 63 per cent. In that election, as in the one in 1998, the President\u2019s party \u2014 this time the Republicans \u2013 gained seats in both the House and Senate.THE RULE OR EXCEPTION?So, the question for this year\u2019s mid-terms is whether they will follow the \u201crule\u201d of the midterm elections in 1994, 2006, 2010, and 2014 or the \u201cexception\u201d of the mid-term elections of 1998 and 2002.The answer to this question is how one predicts the impact of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.If the huge Democratic opposition to his nomination is equivalent to the Clinton Impeachment, then this would offset the trend of the Republicans being wiped out by a wave.Will the Democratic opposition and tactics inspire the Republican base to vote in great numbers and turn independents away from a relatively unpopular President?It appears to me that \u201cKavanaugh\u201d is just another example of the hyper-partisanship facing the US and will not offset the President\u2019s below 50 approval rating and the country\u2019s inherent desire for divided government.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nProtesters opposed to Kavanaugh's nomination demonstrated outside the US Capitol, exactly a month before pivotal November 6, 2018 midterm elections (Photo: AFP/CHIP SOMODEVILLA)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Yes, I could be wrong, and the Republicans could hold the House.But that would be ignoring all the recent trends in US elections.Keep that in mind when watching the returns come in on Nov 7.And then prepare for even greater disruption for business in Asia in the second half of President Trump\u2019s first term.Steven R Okun is Senior Advisor to McLarty Associates.

(Photo: AFP/MANDEL NGAN)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Before the summit, I argued that Trump ought to insist that North Korea provide a full, detailed disclosure of what nuclear materials it already has.If Kim refused that request, it would be a sign that he, at least for now, doesn\u2019t intend to fully denuclearise.While the US reportedly dropped that demand, Kim\u2019s refusal to relinquish certain parts of the country\u2019s nuclear programme sent a similar message, while he was seeking the full lifting of sanctions.Trump didn\u2019t rush into an uneven deal, and was able to avoid accusations that he fell for Kim\u2019s charm and gave up too much.The question is what to do next. At Thursday\u2019s press conference, Trump seemed upbeat, and repeatedly underscored that he is committed to continued dialogue with North Korea, and the progress is ongoing, saying that Kim, \u201chas a certain vision and it\u2019s not exactly our vision but it\u2019s a lot closer than it was a year ago\".There was no breakthrough, but Trump can claim progress as long as North Korea continues to hold off on nuclear tests and other provocations. And he emerges from this round having redeemed his image, after many observers went away with the perception that he had been outmanoeuvred by Kim in the last one.READ:\u00a0Kim Jong Un outmanoeuvred Donald Trump in Singapore, a commentaryStill, some American taxpayers must be wondering right now why a contingent from their government spent all the time and money required to fly to Vietnam for a meeting that yielded no results, particularly when there are urgent challenges to address at home.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nUS\u00a0Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u00a0attends a working lunch alongside President Donald Trump during a meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc\u00a0at the Office of Government Hall in Hanoi, Vietnam on\u00a0Feb\u00a027, 2019.

Moon has staked much of his political capital on ongoing engagement with the North, including moves to restart economic cooperation projects.Like Trump, Moon is seeking distraction from stubborn problems on the homefront, particularly high unemployment and weak economic growth.Trump also said on Thursday that he planned to speak with Moon by phone, and the two are certain to keep trying.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in has been left in a difficult position by the no-result in Hanoi AFP/Jung Yeon-je\n                            \n\n                    \n                That brings us back to the old question, does North Korea earnestly plan to denuclearise?There is no obvious reason to believe that they do, nor is there any reason to believe that if Trump and Kim hold another meeting in several months or a year that they will get any closer to a meaningful agreement.CONTINUE WITH NEGOTIATIONHere I must repeat what I\u2019ve been saying for months - that dialogue ought to be preferred, however little it accomplishes towards real denuclearisation, to the alternative of threats and tensions. Even if there is only the smallest chance of getting North Korea to denuclearise, negotiation is the only way to make it happen.I hope Seoul, Washington and Pyongyang keep trying to cooperate, that one side can make some bold proposal that secures a breakthrough. That being said, it will be increasingly difficult for Trump to sell the US public on the need to hold another summit with North Korea.Trump implied on Thursday, with some optimism, that the failure of the Hanoi summit was a bump on an otherwise productive path. \u201cSometimes you have to walk, and this was just one of those times,\u201d he said.It is anyone\u2019s guess when, or if, he will ever walk back to the table.Steven Borowiec is the politics editor of Korea Expose."},

The cities of London and Paris declared official ecological and climate emergencies.Yet there are fears meagre progress could be undermined as developing economies appear no closer to ditching fossil fuels and the United States - the largest historic emitter - looks poised to complete its Paris pullout.\"CLIMATE MAKES US EQUAL\"Environmental activism, of course, is nothing new.As Alfredo Jornet, professor at the University of Oslo, pointed out, indigenous peoples \"have been very active for a long time\" in protesting against climate change and deforestation, often to little fanfare.\"It's easy to be worried about the climate when you have money and privilege,\" said Melina Sakiyama, 34, a Brazilian activist.With the deadline for countries' Paris commitments looming, as well as a series of high-profile environment summits in 2020, this year is unlikely to be a one-off in terms of climate action.\"The question is how to mobilise this unrest in a way that can lead us to better, more peaceful, democratic and sustainable societies,\" said Jornet.\"In a sense, climate change makes us all more equal. It makes us more capable of acting together.\""},

In light of some optimistic takes, there is no reason to believe that Kim is angling for China-style economic reform; North Korea is still run top-down politically and its economy is still overwhelmingly state-owned.Kim has done nothing to indicate that he\u2019s interested in empowering the private sector, thereby building a middle class that would eventually come to challenge his grip on power.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe UN imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2017 after a series of missile and nuclear tests.

On the US side, Trump will be determined to get North Korea to commit to some kind of tangible step toward denuclearisation, and has maintained that such a move will have to come before the easing of sanctions.WHO WILL BLINK FIRST?Kim\u2019s long game is keeping the outside world convinced that he\u2019s no longer insistent on keeping his nukes long enough to get US troops out of South Korea, opening the way for the fulfillment of his end goal of unifying the peninsula under North Korean rule.If Kim can score a declaration of the end of the Korean War, that would open the door discussions on the withdrawal of the 28,500 US troops stationed in South Korea.At the very least, at such a point, the negotiations will have to get specific: Trump will have to dangle a carrot, such as partial sanctions relief, that he is willing to put up in return for a specific measure from North Korea.Who will blink first?

We\u2019ve made incredible progress.He may be overstating the accomplishments somewhat, but for the most part, he\u2019s right. Even empty meetings are better than war.Unlike Trump, Kim doesn\u2019t have to worry about term limits or the noise of a free press. He expects to lead his country indefinitely and can be patient. If Kim doesn\u2019t like the \u201ccorresponding measures\u201d Trump offers, he will be willing to walk away, and threaten to refuse further rounds of talks.When the summit is held, Kim will have leverage, and the pressure will be on the US to give up something he finds appealing. If the two sides can\u2019t find common ground on that point, their second summit may be their last.Steven Borowiec is the politics editor of Korea Expose."},

Japan, India, Australia and South Korea and other likeminded countries in the region are economically entangled with China.\u00a0The latest warning came from Singapore\u2019s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at November\u2019s ASEAN summit:If you are friends with two countries which are on different sides, sometimes it is possible to get along with both, sometimes it\u2019s more awkward when you try to get along with both.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong speaking at a press conference following the close of the 33rd ASEAN Summit on Nov 15, 2018.

During the 1990s, an engaged China promised to abide by the Missile Technology Control Regime, acceded to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and signed the Chemical Weapons Convention.\u00a0Today\u2019s challenges of North Korea, counterterrorism and cybersecurity require major powers to work together rather than against one another.\u00a0During the Obama administration, Washington and Beijing reached an unprecedented agreement on controlling cyberattacks as well as a landmark agreement in Paris to curb rising temperatures.NEW PARADIGM NEEDED TO IMPROVE BILATERAL RELATIONSFormer US President Richard Nixon\u2019s 1972 visit to China changed the configuration of the Cold War and brought the People\u2019s Republic into a world that it once denounced as \u201cdominated by American imperialists\".The relationship of 47 years could not have been possible without the subsequent talks that produced three landmark communiques in 1972, 1979 and 1982 \u2013 regarded as the foundation for modern US-China relations \u2013 signed when China\u2019s GDP was merely a fraction of the US GDP.Washington and Beijing should seek a new paradigm in the bilateral relationship.\u00a0First, the two countries must develop a new set of rules in trade and economics, incorporating these into existing agreements and encouraging both economies to prosper in the 21st century. This would also involve setting norms in areas such as technology as well as inbound and outbound investments.Second, Washington and Beijing must figure out how to coexist militarily. As China expands its military presence, the existing security alignment in the region changes, too.\u00a0Peace depends on a sustainable risk-managing mechanism developed by both sides to avoid tit-for-tat military confrontation, for example over the South China Sea.READ:\u00a0What difference will new aerial guidelines make amid South China Sea tensions?

They can damage water supply infrastructure and water catchments, impeding the treatment processes that normally make our water safe to drink.Several areas in New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria have already been issued with warnings about the quality of their drinking water.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementSHORT-TERM RISKSBushfires can damage or disrupt water supply infrastructure as they burn. And the risks can persist after the fires are out.A loss of power, for example, disables important water treatment processes such as chlorine disinfection, needed to kill microorganisms and make our water safe to drink.Drinking water for the towns of Eden and Boydtown on the NSW south coast has been affected in this way over recent days. Residents have been advised to boil their water before drinking it and using it for cooking, teeth brushing, and so on.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementREAD:\u00a0Australia issues new evacuation alerts as monster bushfires regenerateOther towns including Cobargo and Bermagui received similar warnings on New Year\u2019s Eve.In some cases, untreated water, straight from a river supply, may be fed directly into drinking water systems.

Various types of bacteria, as well as the parasites giardia and cryptosporidium, could be in such water.Animals including cattle, birds and kangaroos can excrete these microorganisms into river water. Septic tanks and sewage treatment plants may also discharge effluents into waterways, adding harmful microorganisms.Human infection with these microorganisms can cause a range of illnesses, including gastrointestinal diseases with symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting.LONG-TERM RISKSBushfires can damage drinking water catchments, which can lead to longer term threats to drinking water. Drinking water catchments are typically forested areas, and so are vulnerable to bushfire damage.Severe impacts to waterways may not occur until after intense rainfall. Heavy rain can wash ash and eroded soil from the fires into waterways, affecting drinking water supplies downstream.For example, bushfire ash contains nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorous. Increased nutrient concentrations can stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria, commonly known as \u201cblue-green algae\u201d.READ:\u00a0Australian authorities warn bushfire reprieve will be over soon\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nBlack ash and fire debris is washed up on Boydtown Beach and the banks of the Nullica River in Eden, Australia January 7, 2020.

Some cyanobacteria can produce toxic chemicals, requiring very careful management to protect treated drinking water.Many water treatment plants include filtration processes to filter small suspended particles from the water. But an increase in suspended particles, like that which we see after bushfires, would challenge most filtration plants.\u00a0The suspended particles would be removed, but they would clog the filters, requiring them to be more frequently pulled from normal operation and cleaned.This cleaning, or backwashing, is a normal part of the treatment process. But if more time must be spent backwashing, that\u2019s less time the filters are working to produce drinking water.\u00a0And if the rate of drinking water filtration is slowed and fails to keep pace with demand, authorities may place limitations on water use.BOILING WATER NOT ALWAYS ENOUGHIn order to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal and other illnesses, water suppliers and health departments may issue a boil water alert, as we\u2019ve seen in the past week. Bringing water to a \u201crolling boil\u201d can reliably kill most of the microorganisms of concern.In cases where water may be contaminated with chemical substances rather than microorganisms, boiling is usually not effective.\u00a0So where there\u2019s a risk of chemical contamination, public health messages are usually \u201cdo not drink tap water\u201d. This means bottled water only.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nA water bomber drops its load on a bushfire in Nana Glen, near Coffs Harbour, Australia.

Trump replied that he would try his best to do so.The talks, which are expected to last one day, are set to focus on North Korea's rapidly advancing nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.\n    Advertisement\"I think it will be a big success,\" Trump said as he boarded Air Force One, on his way to a political rally in Indiana.US officials said the release of Americans Kim Hak-song, Tony Kim and Kim Dong-chul removed a major obstacle to the summit, providing Trump with some tangible evidence that his twin-track policy of engagement and \"maximum pressure\" was working.\"We're not under any illusions about who these people are. We know who we are dealing with here,\" said Victoria Coates, of the National Security Council.\"But we got, up front, our people home.\"NEUTRAL SETTINGThe United States and North Korea are technically still at war -\u00a0a stop-gap armistice ended the brutal three-year Korean war in 1953 and around 30,000 American troops remain in neighbouring South Korea, which the US supported in the conflict.Singapore will provide a neutral backdrop for the summit, avoiding some of the security and political challenges associated with a meeting in the Demilitarised Zone that separates North and South Korea.When Trump and Kim do sit down a month from now, the two relatively untested leaders will be presented with a puzzle that has stymied seasoned diplomats for decades.A series of US administrations have sent envoys, both official and unofficial, to Pyongyang in the hope of stopping North Korea's provocative nuclear weapons programme.Former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter visited after leaving office, multiple rounds of non-proliferation talks have taken place, and a deal was even signed in 1994.But despite the optimism of that moment, all efforts to limit North Korea's nuclear programme have, to date, failed. And more than two decades and multiple provocative weapons tests after the last accord, the threat from Pyongyang has only grown.The country is now believed to be on the cusp of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile that could deliver a nuclear warhead to the US mainland.Trump has vowed that he will not let that happen and has demanded that North Korea give up its nukes.'CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM'So far, the North Korean regime has made vague pledges to \"denuclearise\" but has not spelt out what that means, when it would happen or how it would be implemented.In North Korea's bombastic rhetoric, \"denuclearisation\" has, for years, been a byword for US troop withdrawals from South Korea and an excuse for stalling.Hardliners in the North are believed to see possession of a nuclear weapon as the only guarantee against US-led efforts to topple Kim's regime.Coates said there were no preconditions for the talks, which could yet include other regional leaders such as the South Korean president, but concrete steps would be welcome.\"The president's goal is very clear -\u00a0the irreversible, verifiable removal of this nuclear weapons programme. If he doesn't see material progress to that, there's not going to be a deal for a deal's sake,\" she said.Coates said that North Korea handing over details about its existing programme would \"set us up with a greater chance of success, anything that they would like to do, but we haven't been signalling pre-conditions up until this point.\"Trump's high-profile meeting offers a glimmer of hope of a breakthrough, according to Republican Senator Cory Gardner, who discussed preparations for the summit with Trump at the White House on Wednesday.\"This is a moment for cautious optimism,\" Gardner told AFP. \"The president understands that there is a historic opportunity to achieve what the world has been unable to achieve for decades.\"At the same time, Gardner said, Trump's eyes were wide open about the risks of failure and the need to be clear that denuclearisation means abandoning nuclear weapons.\"As of last night, there was no nuance in terms of denuclearisation,\" he said.But before any technical talk about reprocessed fuel rods, separated plutonium or spent fuel removal, Trump will want to answer one basic question -\u00a0whether North Korea wants to change.\"This is the key test,\" said Gardner. \"I think that if Kim Jong Un wants to find relief from 'maximum pressure' and be welcomed back to the table of recognised global leadership, it's the only path he has.\"Since the foundation of North Korea in 1948, the country has endured war and struggled to balance rival Soviet and Chinese spheres of influence.Decades of financial stagnation, international sanctions, mass starvation and industrial scale human rights abuses followed.\"The road we have been down is well travelled and it's never ended well. So I hope this time is different,\" said Gardner."},

He offered no plan on how to do it.It was the speech of a president whose power is rapidly draining. It came barely a week after Mr Trump caved into Democratic pressure to reopen the US government following a record 35-day shutdown without having secured a dime of funding for the wall.READ:\u00a0The stalemate over US government shutdown has politically damaged the\u00a0president, a commentaryTHE WALL\n    AdvertisementIt came just eight days before the US government is set to close again unless Mr Trump agrees to whatever budget deal a bipartisan committee sends to his desk.

It was clear Mr Trump neither expected, nor particularly wanted, to make bipartisan hay with the Democrats. The feeling was clearly mutual. The 2020 election is already under way.Two things are clear. The first is that Mr Trump will bill the election as a battle between him and a socialist. \u201cWe were born free and we will stay free,\u201d he said on Tuesday.

George W Bush told allies they were \u201ceither with us, or against us\u201d in the war on terror, and President Trump is taking a similar line in the new information war.The UK has allowed Huawei into the periphery of its 3G and 4G networks \u2014 the masts, antennas and other radio equipment to transmit mobile data \u2014 while keeping it out of the core, where the customer data and sensitive technology mainly resides. The UK government also makes Huawei submit to having hardware and software checked by specialists.NOT SO EASY IN 5G NETWORKS\u00a0That line is harder to draw in new 5G networks, which may be embedded in factory equipment and autonomous cars. That technology, which Huawei helped to develop, is more like a mesh in which data are widely distributed.\u201cYou can interfere with quite a lot of it by interfering with a small amount,\u201d says Alan Woodward, a computer science professor at the University of Surrey.This brings us back to Liaoyang and the sophisticated machinery that Mr Ren set out to emulate. Like other Chinese companies, Huawei probably took some shortcuts along the way by reverse-engineering rival products, but it has climbed the value chain sufficiently to be a leader now. If it hailed from another country, the case against it for state espionage would fail.The evidence against the Chinese government is open and shut, though \u2014 the party that sent Mr Ren to Liaoyang values its political power above everything else and requires complete loyalty.Taking a security bet on Huawei in 5G networks when its main competitors, Ericsson and Nokia, are European no longer feels sensible.

In more than an hour of banter with a room full of reporters, the US president revealed a list of American concessions that went well beyond anything Mr Kim could have imagined.A VICTORY FOR KIM JONG UNAlong with a promise to end joint military exercises with South Korea, Mr Trump said he expected a formal peace treaty between the two countries would be signed soon and indicated his strong desire to eventually remove around 30,000 US troops stationed in South Korea (it does not appear to have been consulted before Mr Trump decided to unilaterally end the joint exercises).\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nIn a blockbusting press conference after the summit, Trump said the US would halt military exercises with Seoul -- something long sought by Pyongyang, which claims the drills are a rehearsal for invasion (Photo: AFP/SAUL LOEB)\n                            \n\n                    \n                \n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementIn that context, the short joint statement signed by the two men can only be interpreted as a victory for the North Korean dictator.\u00a0Apart from bland commitments on both sides to establish new relations and work towards peace, the document committed Pyongyang to merely \u201cwork towards the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\u201d.Mr Trump chose to ignore the fact that Mr Kim\u2019s regime interprets that phrase as the removal of America\u2019s nuclear umbrella from South Korea in exchange for denuclearisation in the north.\u00a0In outlining the concessions he had extracted from Mr Kim, the US president complained he had not had enough time at this summit to agree a more comprehensive \u201cde-nuke\u201d agreement.\n    AdvertisementHe lingered on Pyongyang\u2019s commitment to return the remains of American soldiers killed or captured in the Korean war and talked vaguely about Mr Kim\u2019s promise to destroy a missile engine testing site at some point in the future. Both promises are meaningless from Mr Kim\u2019s perspective.Mr Trump did say tough sanctions on North Korea would not be lifted until real progress was made towards denuclearisation.\u00a0But enforcement of those sanctions is largely in the hands of China, North Korea\u2019s biggest trading partner and benefactor, and on Tuesday a spokesperson for the Chinese government insisted sanctions should be eased to reward North Korean commitments to peace.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nChina praised US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for \"creating a new history\" (Photo: AFP/Susan Walsh)\n                            \n\n                    \n                If Mr Trump changes his mind and attempts to ramp up sanctions again it is now very unlikely China would be willing to enforce them.Beijing has watched this summit from the sidelines but will celebrate Mr Trump\u2019s talk of troop drawdowns and cancelling US military exercises, which he called \u201cvery expensive\u201d and \u201cvery provocative\u201d.One of China\u2019s most treasured goals is the eventual removal of US troops from its neighbourhood.RESTORING NORTH KOREA ECONOMYAt one point in his press conference, Mr Trump provided some insight into his mindset when he asked everyone to \u201cthink of it from a real estate perspective\u201d.He advised Mr Kim to imagine the potential of his \u201cbeautiful beaches\u201d if he were to stop using them for artillery exercises and built condos on them instead.Buried in these musings is the valid point that North Korea has much to gain if it can get support from the US and its capitalist neighbours to help restore its devastated Communist economy.If it can get help with building its economy while keeping its nuclear weapons, that is certainly the preferred option.It is quite possible Mr Trump will return to the US and change his mind about some of the promises he made. It is also possible his apparently overwhelming display of goodwill towards the dictator will lead to real concessions on the part of Pyongyang.But for now Mr Kim has shown himself to be the cannier dealmaker.\u00a9 2018 The Financial Times Ltd.

(PHOTO: AP FILE)\n\n                            \n\n                    \n                It is encouraging that the eight dialogue partners that make up the ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus), including China and the US lent \u201cin-principle\u201d support for the world\u2019s first multilateral set of guidelines governing behaviour between military air forces.There is every reason to cheer for this, but it is still important not to go away with the illusion that the situation may change for the better any time, at least in the foreseeable future.NOT NEWAs far as China and the US are concerned, the ADMM\u2019s new aerial guidelines are anything but novel, one reason why there\u2019s no reason for either to object.The two powers had inked very similar provisions in bilateral agreements since 2014, including a Memorandum of Understanding\u00a0(MOU) regarding the Rules of Behaviour for Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters in 2014, and the Agreement on Establishing a Consultation Mechanism to Strengthen Military Maritime Safety.\u00a0Both sides have also agreed in the following year to more detailed rules of engagement for air-to-air encounters in a subsequent supplement to the 2014 MOU.In fact, comparing the two mechanisms, the ADMM\u2019s aerial guidelines seems to draw more than just inspiration much from the 2015 Supplement \u2013 and yet the US-China agreements are far more elaborate document, for example containing provisions for annual assessment meetings to review their effectiveness, and specific communications rules.DONE NOTHING TO PREVENT INCIDENCESThe existence of such agreements between the US and China did not ensure total compliance, however.In May 2016, two Chinese J-11 fighter jets flew within 15m of a US Navy EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft east of Hainan island, in what US authorities described as an \u201cunsafe\u201d encounter, and a violation of the inked agreements.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nFile photo of a Chinese fighter jet. (Photo: Reuters)\u00a0\n                            \n\n                    \n                In February 2017, another \u201cunsafe\u201d aerial incident happened, in the general vicinity of the Scarborough Shoal, when a US Navy P-3C maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese KJ-200 airborne early warning plane flew within about 304m of each other.Fortunately, most of the interactions between Chinese and US air and maritime forces have been safe and professional, and incidents did not escalate into more serious mishaps thanks in no small part to a factor more important than the presence of these agreements - the continued bilateral channels of communications.MORAL SUASIONIf anything, the ASEAN Defence Ministers\u2019 adoption of these aerial guidelines may have the effect of impressing upon Beijing and Washington the urgency of prudently managing safe maritime and aerial interactions between their forces, and expressing ASEAN\u2019s collective concerns about tensions in the South China Sea to shape regional norms of good behaviour.But there are clearly limitations on what this new initiative can possibly accomplish, even if it is adopted by other extra-regional parties.What we must keep in mind is that China and the US will likely continue to implement and gradually augment their bilateral mechanisms to manage conflict, regardless whether guidelines are promulgated to the ADMM-Plus.No doubt extra-regional powers will at least express support for such initiatives to show their support for ASEAN\u2019s continued relevance and centrality within the regional security architecture.As Singapore\u2019s Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen described:\u00a0Big powers recognise ... and trust us (ASEAN) to be in the driver's seat.Given its pivotal role in maintaining regional peace and stability in the South China Sea, ASEAN will do well to heed caution because it risks being pulled apart, where many regional countries are looking at security cooperation that do not include others, so that they can influence and shape ASEAN\u2019s position.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nSingapore's Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen gives the opening address at the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting in Singapore on Oct\u00a019, 2018. (Photo: Reuters)\n\n                            \n\n                    \n                The inaugural ASEAN-China Maritime Exercise that commenced this week, and the ASEAN-US maritime exercise slated for next year, aptly demonstrate ASEAN\u2019s magnified role in the intensifying geopolitical rivalry playing out between Beijing and Washington.TEMPER EXPECTATIONSLast week\u2019s ASEAN meetings certainly constitute major diplomatic accomplishments for ASEAN, but it is necessary to temper expectations when it comes to how the US and China will manage their encounters, especially in the South China Sea.Given the pace of activities taking place in and around the disputed waters, tensions are not likely to subside anytime soon.Nevertheless, ASEAN-led initiatives such as ADMM and ADMM-Plus remain useful insofar as they help constantly remind all concerned parties to manage tensions out of control.Collin Koh is research fellow with the Maritime Security Programme, at the S.

So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe,\" he said, just 10 days before a deadline for Congress to reach a bipartisan agreement on funding for border security.\n    AdvertisementTrump also used his address to\u00a0call for a bipartisan commitment to eradicate AIDS in the United States within a decade.\"Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach,\" Trump said in his annual address to Congress.\"My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years,\" he said.\"Together, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond.\"NORTH KOREA SUMMITPresident Trump also confirmed a second\u00a0summit with\u00a0North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam on Feb\u00a027 and 28.\u00a0\"As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula.

Compare this to 2009, when Victoria\u2019s \u201cBlack Saturday\u201d fires claimed more than 2,000 homes in February, or 1983, when the \u201cAsh Wednesday\u201d fires destroyed about 2,400 homes in Victoria and South Australia, also in February.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementThe 2020 fire season could end up surpassing these tragedies, despite the lessons learned and improvements in preparedness.READ:\u00a0Australia fires: RSAF Chinooks to bring relief supplies, help with evacuationOne lesson not really learned, though, is that home insurance is rarely sufficient to enable recovery. The evidence is many people losing their homes will find themselves unable to rebuild, due to lack of insurance.We know this from interviews with those affected by the October 2013 Blue Mountains bushfires (in which almost 200 homes were destroyed). Despite past disasters, more than 65 per cent of households affected were underinsured.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementResearch published by the Victorian government in 2017, meanwhile, estimated just 46 per cent Victorian households have enough insurance to recover from a disaster, with 28 per cent underinsured and 26 per cent having no insurance.The consequences aren\u2019t just personal. They potentially harm local communities permanently, as those unable to rebuild move away. Communities lose the vital knowledge and social networks that make them resilient to disaster.MISCALCULATING REBUILDING COSTSAll too often the disaster of having your home and possessions razed by fire is followed by the disaster of realising by how much you are underinsured.\n    AdvertisementAs researchers into the impact of fires, we are interested why people find themselves underinsured. Our research, which includes interviewing those who have have lost their homes, shows it is complicated, and not necessarily due to negligence.READ:\u00a0Australia prepares for renewed bushfire threat as economic costs mount\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nA resident uses a water hose to wet down a house as high winds from a southerly change push smoke and ash from the Currowan Fire towards Nowra, New South Wales, Australia January 4, 2020.

She told us:You think sure, yeah, I can rebuild my life with that much money. But nowhere near. Not even close. We wound up with a A$700,000 mortgage at the end of rebuilding.AN EXTRA MORTGAGEA common issue is that people insure based on their home\u2019s market value. But rebuilding is often more expensive.For one thing there\u2019s the need to comply with new building codes, which have been improved to ensure buildings take into account their potential exposure to bushfire. This is likely to increase costs by 20 per cent or more, but is rarely made clear to insurance customers.READ:\u00a0Australian bushfire cloud visible in Chile and ArgentinaConstruction costs also often spike following disasters, due to extra demand for building services and materials.A further contributing factor is that banks can claim insurance payments to pay off mortgages, meaning the only way to rebuild is by taking out another mortgage.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nA resident uses a garden hose to wet down the house as high winds push smoke and ash from the Currowan Fire towards Nowra, New South Wales, Australia January 4, 2020.

I helped them all I could there. That\u2019s probably why we lost the business, because how can you ask people to pay when they\u2019ve got nothing?UNDERMINING SOCIAL COHESIONIn rural areas there is often a shortage of rental properties. Insurance companies generally only cover rent for 12 months, which is not enough time to rebuild. For families forced to relocate, moving back can feel disruptive to their recovery.Under-insurance significantly increases the chances those who lose their homes will move away and never return \u2013 hampering social recovery and resilience. Residents that cannot afford to rebuild will sell their property, with \u201ctree changers\u201d the most likely buyers.Communities not only lose residents with local knowledge and important skills but also social cohesion. Research in both Australia and the United States suggested this can leave those communities less prepared for future disasters.This is because a sense of community is vital to individuals\u2019 willingness and ability to prepare for and act in a threat situation. A confidence that others will weigh in to help in turn increases people\u2019s confidence and ability to prepare and act.In Whittlesea, for example, residents reported a change in their sense of community cohesion after the Black Saturday fires. \u201cThe newer people coming in,\u201d one interviewee told us, \u201caren\u2019t invested like the older people are in the community.\u201dAustralia is one of the few wealthy countries that heavily relies on insurance markets for recovery from disasters.But the evidence suggests this is an increasingly fraught strategy, particularly when rural communities also have to cope with the reality of more intense and frequent extreme weather events.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nA helicopter drops fire retardent to protect a property in Balmoral, 150km\u00a0southwest of Sydney on Dec\u00a019, 2019.

Smoke has blanketed Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, and drifted as far as South America.The meteorology bureau said climate change and natural drivers, including warmer than normal waters in the Indian Ocean off Africa, had made 2019 Australia's hottest and driest year on record, with the highest ever forest fire danger rating.The country had only 6 per cent\u00a0of its typical annual rainfall last year, while daytime temperatures across were more than 2 degrees Celsius\u00a0above normal.\"These are large departures that we saw in 2019, both in terms of how different they were to the average temperatures and rainfall that we see, but also compared to previous records as well,\" Braganza said.He said these were part of longer term trends in temperature and fire weather that the bureau has observed. Rainfall has been tracked since 1900 and temperatures since 1910.\"Australia's getting warmer, the fire season's getting longer and the severity of the fire weather during that season is getting more frequent and severe,\" Braganza said.\"When we look at the projections that we do for climate change, certainly Australia should be preparing for those trends to continue.\"\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nSmoke and haze over mountains are seen from a No 11 Squadron P-8A Poseidon conducting damage assessment and surveillance in the bushfire-affected area near Cooma, New South Wales, Australia, January 7, 2020.

Therefore, while a decoupling of American and Chinese interests in these areas will deal a major blow to Beijing\u2019s economic and geopolitical interests, it will have similar effects on global value chains and ecosystems.As to the degree of decoupling, a range of different outcomes could play out and businesses need to start mapping out scenarios ranging from mild to extreme decoupling.\u00a0For all outcomes, firms are going to have to learn to live with increased uncertainty as they contemplate the extent to which they will have to decouple and where they will turn to for new markets, partnerships and livelihoods.US SANCTIONS AND TECHNOLOGY CONTROLS The amount of collateral damage caused by US sanctions and blocked technology licenses cannot be overstated. When the US government threatened China telecoms manufacturer ZTE with a seven-year ban on access to US tech suppliers, for example, US companies such as Qualcomm, Android Software, Google, Microsoft \u2014 and\u00a0 their legions of smaller suppliers and subcontractors \u2014 were all adversely impacted.\u00a0It turns out that American firms account for more than 30 per cent of the components and technology that go into a \u201cChinese\u201d ZTE phone.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nThe logo of China's ZTE Corp is seen on a building in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, China, April 19, 2018. )File photo: REUTERS)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Washington eventually backed off from its threats, which saved ZTE from likely collapse. But this begs the question: If Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, is Washington willing to pursue ZTE enforcement style strategies to decouple US tech firms from other Chinese companies?So far, yes.The Trump administration has just slapped technology export restrictions on Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Company, another state-funded tech firm.Citing national security risks and allegations of a well-orchestrated Chinese campaign to steal trade secrets from Micron, the American firm that makes DRAM technology, US authorities have placed Fujian Jinhua on a restricted entity list.For Fujian Jinhua, the spigot to US tech has been turned off, but even non-US firms that incorporate American technology in their own products are affected, as they are also banned from doing business with this Chinese company.The penalties for violating these sanctions are harsh: Huge monetary fines, revocation of US operating licenses, blocked access to US dollar-denominated transactions in the international banking system, and even jail time for company executives.How should a tech firm factor in these threats as it tries to hedge its risks in its business dealing with China? Does it follow a risk-averse strategy and pre-emptively decouple or should it live dangerously and wait for the next round of sanctions from Washington?\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nChip-making facilities at Tawian's United Microelectronics Corstands\u00a0accused of helping Chinese company Fujian Jinhua steal advanced semiconductor technology from US firm Micron (Photo: AFP/SAM YEH)\n                            \n\n                    \n                READ:\u00a0Yes, it's time to end the US-China trade war, a commentaryTHE MASSIVE SCALE OF DISENTANGLEMENT According to Barry Jaruzelski, a principle in PWC\u2019s Global Strategy group, 80 per cent of the corporate research and development (R&D) money spent in China in 2017 came from non-Chinese multinationals.These R&D ecosystems are linked to extensive collaborative networks of businesses, universities and talent pools, all of which, in turn, are supported by a myriad service providers such as advisory firms, financial institutions and IT companies.The scale of China\u2019s local R&D and product development market is massive. McKinsey, the global consultancy, estimates that the total demand for new components generated by local R&D and product development centres in China will be valued at US$500 billion, by 2020.But much of this tech still passes through global value chains. Sanford Bernstein, a research company, reports that China imported around US$160 billion worth of integrated circuit-related technology in 2016, making semiconductors its number one import\u2014surpassing even oil imports.READ:\u00a0As summits approach, winds of trade war hit region, a commentaryEvery area of Beijing\u2019s Made in China 2025 technology master plan is dependent on foreign-owned integrated circuit technology, with much of it coming from five American manufacturers: AMD, Intel, Micron, Nvidia and Qualcomm.Not surprisingly, key groups in the US semiconductor industry are worried about the collateral damage from an increase in sanctions and have been lobbying the Trump administration to exercise restraint \u2014 even while they have been complaining about Beijing\u2019s efforts to promote its own tech champions. \u00a0In the short term, the ideal scenario would be to obtain a similar outcome to the ZTE case, where Washington decided not to enforce a technology ban, while, simultaneously, a constructive dialogue between Washington and Beijing could begin to work out some sort of modus vivendi.Simple logic would dictate that leadership on both sides should engage and try to avoid the carnage of an extreme decoupling.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nDonald Trump's tweet that he had 'a long and very good conversation with President Xi Jinping of China' boosted market optimism.

Many observers of Sino-US relations have concluded that US Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s recent speech at the Hudson Institute \u2014 where he proclaimed that the US will not back down From Beijing\u2019s aggression \u2014 was the equivalent of the Iron Curtain speech made by Winston Churchill in 1946, which marked the beginning of the Cold War between the West and the Soviet Union.Meanwhile, anti-China sentiment in the US Congress, across both political parties, is at an all-time high. Democratic gains in the 2018 mid-term elections, in US House of Representatives, will not change this.Thus, Congress will remain largely silent while a small group of economic nationalists like Peter Navarro, adviser to President Trump on trade matters, and Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce, exert undue influence over US trade policy.Increased US-China decoupling in the tech sector, therefore, is a real and increasingly likely scenario. While the full extent of a decoupling is hard to predict, tech firms, from the world\u2019s largest to the newest start-ups, need to adopt new ways to manage this risk.Alex Capri is Visiting Senior Fellow with the Department of Analytics & Operations at NUS Business School."},

Many Chinese traffickers convicted for peddling smaller amounts had met the gallows.This huge outcry against expat leniency had inspired another Chinese prosecutor to appeal to the court to increase his sentencing, where the court found Schellenberg guilty of being part of an international syndicate, in plotting to smuggle pellets of meth out of Dalian to Australia.\n    AdvertisementOver the years, the Chinese have grown weary of hearing tales of foreigners who come to the country to party, womanise and spread the use of drugs. Schellenberg himself had been charged with several drug-related offences even back home in Vancouver, inconsequential to the case at hand but unhelpful for his image nonetheless in the court of public opinion.Since 2014, the Chinese government has launched a nationwide crackdown on drugs, sparing no one.

When Chinese citizens and residents obey the laws of the land, they expect foreigners to do the same and for justice to be dispensed if not.Many Chinese take a moralistic view towards drugs and there is strong support towards China\u2019s tough anti-drug laws, which prescribes the death penalty for anyone found guilty of drug trafficking of more than 50 grams of heroine or meth.Such attitudes clearly differ from Canada, a nation that has liberalised its drug laws over the years, including making it legal to buy marijuana starting last October. But repugnance to the laws of one country aside, the fact is that people have to obey the laws of the land that they visit.READ:\u00a0A winter of discontent awaits after Huawei executive arrested, a commentaryDETERIORATING CANADA-CHINA TIESThe timing of Schellenberg\u2019s retrial has been unfortunate, and no doubt, conflation with the Meng Wanzhou situation will be hard to avoid, as observers try to read the tea leaves on the implications for China-Canada relations.China has frequently come under pressure from the West on its application of capital punishment but feels keenly the need to uphold its domestic laws, notwithstanding that Schellenberg would be the first Canadian to be executed in China if so.In this case, the shock of Schellenberg\u2019s sentence against the backdrop of deteriorating relations between Canada and China in recent months no doubt left Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau feeling the heat. Expressing great concern, Trudeau has accused Beijing of having chosen to arbitrarily applying capital punishment.Human rights organisations and the Canadian government are crying foul over the death penalty sentence imposed on Schellenberg and exerting pressure on China to back down from the court\u2019s ruling.Schellenberg has 10 days to appeal against the sentencing, and his case may be reviewed by a higher court before the death sentence is carried out.In the coming days, this pressure will only increase but it would be imperative for the Chinese to uphold its principled stance on this matter.Tom McGregor is a commentator on Asia-Pacific affairs based in Beijing."},

He echoes Trump\u2019s assertion that his ultimate aim is a world with zero tariffs.\u00a0He would have us believe that Trump\u2019s tariffs are a means to an end: A\u00a0bargaining chip to correct foreigners\u2019 unfair trade practices.READ:\u00a0Trump tariffs have barely perceptible impact on the world, a commentary\n    Advertisement\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nDonald Trump has frequently accused China of stealing US jobs through unfair trade practices and currency manipulation (Photo: AFP/Greg Baker)\n\n\n                            \n\n                    \n                Fair enough, but Navarro\u2019s view of what is unfair is wide-ranging. Trade and foreign investment rules should be reciprocal. America\u2019s intellectual property (IP) rules should apply to everyone.\u00a0Bilateral trade should be balanced (i.e. little or no net capital flows). Trade deficits are \u201cgiving away wealth\u201d. \u00a0In Republican doctrine and conventional economics, these \u201cunfair\u201d tactics should actually have held China back: Tariffs, industry protection, a distorted exchange rate, bureaucrat-run enterprises, financial subsidies, central planning, excessive regulation, and pervasive government interference should all weaken the economy.\u00a0But Trump is not waiting until the China model fails or mutates. He wants to discipline it through a tariff war.SECURITY PREPAREDNESSThe second concern is the threat to American security preparedness from globalisation. China uses state-controlled industry policy to strengthen its defence security, while offshoring, foreign investment, and international supply chains have undercut American self-sufficiency in vital security industries and allowed vital IP to leak to potential enemies.Navarro\u2019s answer to China\u2019s strategic industry policy is for America to adopt the same planned strategic industrial policy, \u201con-shoring\u201d vital production. This is not just a temporary bargaining instrument. But it falls far short of \u201cdecoupling\u201d.All this could be fairly benign. Trade agreements could be renegotiated, like the North American Free Trade Agreement\u00a0and the US-Korea agreement have been tweaked \u2013 adversely, in the view of many economic commentators, but not disastrously, as some had feared.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nWhite House trade advisor Peter Navarro (Photo: AFP/JIM WATSON)\u00a0\n                            \n\n                    \n                In the process, some tariff barriers might actually fall \u2013 Europe has already shown readiness to reduce its auto-tariffs.Security self-sufficiency (if \u201csecurity\u201d is narrowly defined) has often been an objective of governments. For a large, diverse economy such as the US, the cost in terms of trade-diversion and resource maldistribution may not be too great.There is, however, a less benign outcome. If the objective is to inflict maximum damage on China, in the hope of significantly slowing its technological advance and the near-inevitable of China\u2019s GDP exceeding Americas within a decade, then this seems both futile and potentially hugely damaging.\u00a0Permanent measures invite retaliatory chain-reactions. In addition to the damage which conventional economics predicts, this policy rules out possibilities of compromise and cooperation, not only on security issues but on global public goods currently provided by international agencies such as the UN, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organisation.\u00a0Global-wide problems such as climate change go unaddressed.READ:\u00a0The end of unrestricted commerce and the dawn of the great US-China disentanglement, a commentaryECONOMIC MINDSETThere would be more confidence in the benign outcome if Trump\u2019s economic mindset were less confused.\u00a0If Trump the dealmaker wants to use America\u2019s heft to arm-wrestle European trade protection down and make China pay more for their IP (in 2017, they paid a not-inconsiderable US$29 billion), then his confusions about bilateral trade balances, his preference for bilateral deals over multilateral, and his spurious security grounds for tariffs might not matter too much, provided other nations can maintain their multilateral focus.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nUS\u00a0President Donald Trump holds his signed memorandum on intellectual property tariffs on high-tech goods from China, at the White House in Washington, US\u00a0March 22, 2018.

Of course, America should vigorously protect its security secrets.But it would be over-reach for Trump to see China\u2019s detailed planning for technological progress as somehow an illegitimate product of an authoritarian system.\u00a0It was Eisenhower who first fretted about the American \u201cmilitary-industrial complex\u201d.China\u2019s sin is not its economic model.

Singapore has neither the capacity nor the desire to dominate the world.\u00a0But if Trump is to achieve the benign outcome and develop an effective strategy in response to China\u2019s rise, he needs greater clarity of objectives, effective instruments, and an understanding of economics which goes beyond the \u201cart of the deal\u201d.Stephen Grenville is a nonresident fellow at the Lowy Institute.

This also puts China\u2019s ambitious development objectives in question as well.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementSecond, the tools of statecraft which China seems to rely on in managing the more tempestuous global environment are remarkably limited, and often counterproductive.The 46-year-old Meng, daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei and the firm\u2019s chief financial officer, was arrested on Dec 1\u00a0in Vancouver. She faces charges in the United States of fraud involving millions of dollars in an attempt to evade US sanctions of Iran.\u00a0This has provoked an outcry in China, with its foreign ministry demanding Meng\u2019s release.\u00a0READ:\u00a0Ren Zhengfei, Huawei\u2019s general musters for a fight, a commentaryChinese law enforcement also detained a former Canadian diplomat working in the country as a senior advisor at a prominent non-government organisation.

This represented a change of course for Britain, which has long been more welcoming of Huawei products than its American ally across the Atlantic.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nA woman walks past a Huawei and Apple shops in Beijing, China on Dec\u00a012, 2018.

While such coordinated action from China\u2019s long-time rival in Japan and the Five Eyes intelligence network of the US, Canada, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand might be seen as expected, others come as a bit more of a surprise.India, a market that Huawei has targeted as a potential growth engine for its international smartphone business, decided in September not to include Huawei equipment in its 5G testing.\u00a0This move could signal more restrictive measures towards the firm in the future.\u00a0And Europe, a region in which Huawei has seen strong growth over the past decade, also seems to be changing its tone, as EU tech commissioner Andrus Ansip warned on Dec 7 that the union of 28 nations should \u201cbe worried\u201d about the company.What could perhaps spell the most trouble for Huawei comes from the US, however.\u00a0Although the country has long been stricter than most when it comes to allowing Chinese technology and telecoms equipment, if the US were to find Huawei guilty of violating Iran sanctions, as they did with ZTE earlier this year, banning the company from access to US suppliers would deal a heavy blow.READ:\u00a0A winter of discontent awaits after Huawei executive arrested, a commentaryCHINA'S 'TANTRUM DIPLOMACY' STATECRAFT IS UNLIKELY TO HELPHuawei\u2019s PR practices do not exactly have a reputation for being the most understanding of security concerns and culturally sensitive when it comes to the firm\u2019s overseas markets.\u00a0Yet it is fair to say that these problems are in many ways out of the company\u2019s control. This, rather, is an issue that strikes at the heart of the Chinese system and the goals and values of the Chinese Communist Party.There seems to be a deficit in trust and goodwill between China and much of the rest the world. Lately, the Chinese government does not seem to be helping its cause.The demanding reaction to Meng\u2019s arrest by both the Chinese foreign ministry and state media has been criticised as displaying a lack of understanding of the way in which an independent judiciary functions, and it is unlikely that such action from China will improve the situation.\u00a0But the tactic of leveraging nationalist outrage to achieve diplomatic goals has become a card that China\u2019s leaders play with increasing frequency and intensity.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nHuawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested on an extradition warrant, appears at her B.C.

Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one,\" he said.Trump met Kim in June in Singapore, the first-ever summit between leaders of the two countries that have never formally ended the 1950-53 Korean War, months after the US leader was threatening to obliterate North Korea over its nuclear and missile tests.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementSince the summit, Trump has since mused that he and Kim have fallen \"in love\" and voiced eagerness to meet him, although critics say that North Korea's promises remain vague.The two leaders in Vietnam will need to work out the meaning of North Korea's promise in Singapore of \"denuclearization,\" with Kim envisaging an end to all weapons in the peninsula rather than quickly giving up the arsenal built for decades by the totalitarian dynasty.The US special envoy on North Korea, Stephen Biegun, heads Wednesday for talks in Pyongyang on preparing the summit.Biegun said last week that, while not lifting all sanctions without denuclearization, Washington was ready to take first steps to support North Korea's badly needed economic development.\n    AdvertisementSTOPPING 'ENDLESS WARS'Trump, in a speech focused primarily on domestic priorities including his tough line on immigration, cast himself as a realist in the world, saying he is pursuing \"a foreign policy that puts America's interests first.\"\"Great nations do not fight endless wars,\" Trump said, after his controversial orders to pull all US troops out of Syria and half of the 14,000-strong force in Afghanistan.Trump voiced guarded hope that intensifying negotiations with Afghanistan's Taliban would bring for a \"possible political solution\" to end the longest-ever US war.\"My administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban,\" he said.\"We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement -- but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace,\" he said.US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in January held an unusually long six days of negotiations with Taliban representatives in Qatar.While Khalilzad has stressed that much remains to discuss, the broad goal would be for the United States to pull troops from Afghanistan and for the Taliban to ensure that foreign extremists will not be based on its territory -- the reason for the US invasion after the September 11, 2001 attacks.But the Taliban have refused to negotiate with the internationally recognized government in Kabul. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani tweeted ahead of Trump's speech that he had spoken to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who \"underscored the central importance of ensuring the centrality of the Afghan government in the peace process.\"TIES VENEZUELA TO US POLITICSIn contrast to Trump's frequent instincts to stay out of foreign conflicts, he has intervened forcefully in the crisis in Venezuela where he has recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the interim president.In his address, Trump tied Venezuela to US politics as he tried to equate liberal opponents at home with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whose leftist regime presides over a crumbling economy that has sent millions fleeing to neighboring countries.\"We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom -- and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair,\" Trump said.\"We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country,\" he said to boisterous cheers from Republicans.Left-leaning US lawmakers have rejected such comparisons, saying that their calls for a higher minimum wage and a more stable safety net has nothing to do with the corruption and mismanagement of Venezuela."},

In Victoria state, authorities believe 300 homes have been destroyed.Insurers have received 8,985 bushfire-related claims in NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland since the Insurance Council of Australia declared a bushfire catastrophe on Nov. 8. The claims are estimated to have a loss value of A$700 million. The council recorded the destruction of 1,838 residential properties so far.A backbencher in PM Morrison's government was criticised for an appearance on the \"Good Morning Britain\" ITV program during which he said there was no link between climate change and the bushfire crisis. \"There is no link, the facts that cause the fires are the drought and the drying of the environment,\" lawmaker Craig Kelly said."},

Although Mr Ren resists being defined by his PLA past, his management style and rhetoric has a distinct note of military discipline \u2014 not uncommon for Chinese men of his age.\u201cThis aircraft carrier Huawei which has just set sail needs thousands of heroes to paddle,\u201d he wrote in his note to staff in January, urging them to shake off their weaknesses and shortcomings, so that \u201cwe can become a great warrior\u201d.SACRIFICES AND HARDSHIPSEmployees know that in concrete terms, that means they are expected to make sacrifices for the company \u2014 long hardship postings without family and working through weekends \u2014 and to face unforgiving demands on their performance. \u201cHe will criticise people by name in a room full of colleagues,\u201d says one executive.\u00a0The founder made several senior staff write public apologies or self criticisms, a practice from China\u2019s recent\u00a0past. For foreign staff, this is hard to swallow. Foreign hires tend to stay at Huawei less than a year.\u00a0\u201cYou always remain outside the Chinese core circle, and you are not given the kind of respect you might have been used to at Ericsson,\u201d said a European engineer who left after 10 months. \u201cThey want to be seen as one of us, but they will always be different.\u201dFrom Huawei\u2019s Chinese staff, however, there are few complaints. Most importantly, Mr Ren leads by example. Several years ago, he kept an appointment with the FT despite feeling unwell.\u00a0As a Chinese medicine doctor performed acupressure on his hand, Mr Ren waved for an aide to place an empty champagne cooler at his feet. \u201cJust in case I have to throw up,\u201d he said with a smile, and then carried on talking.\u00a9 2018 The Financial Times Ltd."},

Generally, they were willing to support politicians who bargained with each other. They recognised that, in politics, you can\u2019t get everything you want.But when participants had moral convictions about the political issue, they withdrew support \u2013 even for politicians from their own party. We saw similar patterns on issues with an obvious moral dimension such as same-sex marriage, and also ones where the moral implications are not as clear, such as Social Security reform.More recently, we conducted experiments that more directly test whether people are prone to costly stalemates over political issues they think about in moral terms.LITTLE ROOM FOR COMPROMISEIn an economic game, participants played the role of a legislator. Their job was to bargain over a series of political issues with a person who disagreed with them about those issues. For instance, one participant might want to raise the minimum wage and would therefore be paired with someone who wants to lower it.If they reached a deal, both participants could earn real money \u2013 and more money, the more concessions the opponent agreed to.If they could not reach a deal, then both earned nothing \u2013 analogous to a shutdown where everyone loses.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nHuman rights watchdog, the Council of Europe, says US President Donald Trump is no longer the moral leader of the free world. (Photo: AFP/Nicholas Kamm)\n                            \n\n                    \n                We found that when participants bargained over an issue that had little moral significance such as the cost of road tolls, 72 per cent of pairs reached a bargain.When they bargained over a morally fraught issue such as funding for stem cell research, only 60 per cent of pairs struck a bargain.This was the result of bargaining over fictional political policies. When real policies are at stake, and when both sides are working hard to portray their side as morally righteous, we suspect moral outrage poses an even greater barrier to compromise.\u00a0That\u2019s both because politicians have their own moral convictions, and because they fear repercussions from the citizens who judge them.Many people believe moral considerations have begun to show up in debates over more political issues than they used to, but the evidence is unclear.Either way, compromise is indispensable to many pressing issues \u2013 immigration, criminal justice reform, housing and Brexit, to name just a few.\u00a0When voters and leaders alike cultivate ways to keep moral outrage in check, they will be more likely to find pragmatic solutions to these stubborn divides.Timothy Ryan is a political scientist and associate professor at\u00a0University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\u00a0Andrew W\u00a0Delton is assistant professor of political science and management at\u00a0Stony Brook University (The State University of New York), and Peter DeScioli is assistant professor of political science at the same university.

These predate the Trump administration and are widely shared in governments and business.However, they were also worried about the US administration\u2019s preference for unilateral action over strengthening the multilateral system, its apparent lack of a coherent strategy or an inclusive view of business interests and its relations with regional countries.In particular, pressure to take sides in the dispute - to \u201cchoose a lane\u201d as a US official put it recently - was seen as something to be resisted.\u00a0If anything, it is likely that current US tactics will reinforce hardliners in China and make reforms in areas where there are legitimate concerns less likely.

So would conclusion of the negotiations over the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).While as a trade agreement like the RCEP is not as ambitious as the CPTPP, its country coverage gives it great political importance. Negotiators aim to get at least a long way towards finalising it by the end of the year.Bilateral and other new regional free trade agreements (FTAs) are also increasingly important between Asia-Pacific economies and others, particularly the EU.Completion of the Japan-EU FTA last year was spurred on by concerns about the deteriorating trade environment and the need to reinforce the benefits of integration. It is likely to serve as a template for the agreements that the EU will negotiate next, with Australia, New Zealand and possibly Mercosur (the Common Market of the South comprising Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay).And looking beyond Brexit, the UK\u2019s interest in joining CPTPP has generally been well received.The importance of other platforms for regional cooperation was also endorsed. APEC in particular can provide, through its inclusive membership and its non-binding, consultative nature, a venue for quiet diplomacy where smaller economies can work to influence China and the US.The possibility of using the good offices of the WTO Director-General to mediate between the US and China was also raised at the Forum. This is possible under WTO rules, but both sides would have to be in the market for it, which is clearly not the case now.\u00a0Perhaps some such mediation could become relevant as part of finalising and working out an eventual deal if the two are able to find common ground.ESSENTIAL TO REINFORCE WTOOver the longer term, reinforcing the WTO system is vital. The rules need updating and clarifying, but this can\u2019t mean just targeting China.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nLeaders of\u00a011\u00a0nations sign a slimmed-down version of the TPP\u00a0trade agreement, now known as\u00a0the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in Santiago, Chile, on Mar\u00a08, 2018.

And systemic changes alone are not a cure-all. It\u2019s how its members use the WTO that matters.It is also important not to push the system beyond its limits. The WTO dispute settlement system, already under severe pressure, cannot resolve the fundamental US-China conflict. The way forward has to be through negotiation.Mobilising more active business support for the multilateral system is also essential. This has to go beyond just making statements - effective political lobbying is needed. National and regional business groups have an important part to play here. Recent surveys show their members now see this as a higher priority than in previous years.Some hope that the US will eventually move away from unilateralism if it becomes concerned about FTAs hampering its access to the 95 per cent of the world\u2019s consumers who live outside its borders.The epicentre of growth is still Asia, with its expanding middle class demand.

A lot of work has been done to identify the policy steps required to achieve strong and inclusive growth, reduce financial vulnerability, and stop the erosion of the pillars of longer-term prosperity.And the EU has considerable untapped or underused internal capabilities.

In response to the run on certain items, major retailers have imposed some purchase limits.\u00a0On Saturday morning, about 500 people were lined up for two blocks outside a Costco in Garden Grove, California, waiting for the store to open.Long lines of shoppers were reported outside food stores in other parts of the United States.On Friday, Trump declared a national emergency in a move that he said would bring \"the full power of the federal government\" to bear on the escalating health crisis by freeing up some US$50 billion in aid.

Why?There are two reasons: One pertains to measurement, the other to power.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementThe first explanation is admittedly superficial and bypasses the capital-labour conflict altogether. It is possible, though unlikely, that labour-market tightness is being misread and that many people who want jobs are not being counted.The second reason is more profound: Simply put, labour has lost, and capital has won. Consider the evidence:From 1973 to 2013, hourly compensation of a typical US worker rose just 9 per cent, while productivity increased 74 per cent, putting little pressure on prices but dramatically boosting profits.Of course, this raises another question: Why might capital be stronger than labour?

This has not only hurt workers on the job; it has also damaged labour's ability to lobby for higher minimum wages.Government policy and corporate power have eroded unions\u2019 influence, and laws and regulations have made owning capital more rewarding than ever relative to working.\u00a0READ:\u00a0Politics in the Trump era are stressing out American workers, a commentary\n    Advertisement\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nCooks, cashiers and other minimum wage earners join anti-Trump activists on a march for an increase in the minimum wage to $15/hour during a \u201cMarch on McDonald\u2019s\u201d in Oak Brook, Illinois, US, May 24, 2017.

Instead, wages haven\u2019t budged, and profits have soared.Second, even with low unemployment, workers are insecure at work. While two thirds of Americans say this is a good time to find a quality job, just as many people fear losing their job now as in 1991, when the unemployment rate was 7 per cent, or nearly double what it is today.The third explanation is the rise of super firms. These very large companies \u2013 think of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (the FAANGs)\u00a0\u2013 are consolidating monopoly power.\u00a0While the technology the FAANGs deploy and the scale at which they operate have lowered consumer prices, this come at the high cost of suppressed wages for workers \u2013 who of course are the consumers. \u00a0READ:\u00a0Superstar companies can afford to give their workers a raise, a commentaryFinally, most new jobs today pay poorly. In fact, among the ten occupations now recording the most employment growth, only three \u2013 software developers, registered nurses, and managers \u2013 pay above-average wages.With productivity decoupled from pay because of the rise of super firms and government policies tilted in favour of capital, popular and voter outrage should come as no surprise. But whether protest will lead to meaningful political reform or more of the same remains an open question.Teresa Ghilarducci is professor of economics at The New School for Social Research and the director of the Schwartz Centre\u00a0for Economic Policy Analysis (SCEPA) and The New School\u2019s Retirement Equity Lab (ReLab)."},

Now, since 2017, the US National Security Strategy focuses on great power rivalry, with China and Russia designated as America\u2019s main adversaries.While many Chinese analysts blame this fourth phase on US President Donald Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping is also to blame.By rejecting Deng Xiaoping\u2019s prudent policy of maintaining a low international profile; by ending presidential term limits; and by proclaiming his nationalistic \u201cChina Dream\u201d, Xi might as well have been wearing a red hat reading\u00a0\u201cMake China Great Again.\u201dREAD:\u00a0One month before Trump meets Xi, the world is in for a bumpy ride, a commentarySMOULDERING FIREThe conventional wisdom on China within the US had already begun to sour before the 2016 presidential election. Trump\u2019s rhetoric and tariffs were merely gasoline poured on a smouldering fire.The liberal international order helped China sustain rapid economic growth and reduce poverty dramatically. But China also tilted the trade field to its advantage by subsidising state-owned enterprises, engaging in commercial espionage, and requiring foreign firms to transfer their intellectual property to domestic \u201cpartners\u201d.While most economists argue that Trump is mistaken to focus on the bilateral trade deficit, many support his complaints about China\u2019s efforts to challenge America\u2019s technological advantage.Moreover, China\u2019s growing military strength adds a security dimension to the bilateral relationship.\u00a0While this fourth phase of the relationship is not a cold war, owing to the high degree of interdependence, it is much more than a typical trade dispute like, say, America\u2019s recent clash with Canada over access to that country\u2019s dairy market.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n(File photo: AFP/Greg Baker)\n                            \n\n                    \n                READ: Yes, it's time to end the US-China trade war, a commentaryNOT A THUCYDIDES CRISISSome analysts believe this fourth phase marks the beginning of a conflict in which an established hegemon goes to war with a rising challenger. In his explanation of the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides famously argued that it was caused by Sparta\u2019s fear of a rising Athens.These analysts believe that China\u2019s rise will create a similar fear in the US, and use the analogy of World War I, when a rising Germany set hegemonic Britain on edge.The causes of World War I, however, were far more complex, and included growing Russian power, which created fear in Germany; rising nationalism in the Balkans and other countries; and the risks deliberately taken by the Habsburg Empire to stave off its decline.Even more important, Germany had already surpassed Britain in industrial production by 1900, while China\u2019s GDP (measured in dollars) currently is only three-fifths the size of the US economy.\u00a0The US has more time and assets to manage the rise of Chinese power than Britain had with Germany. China is constrained by a natural balance of power in Asia in which Japan (the world\u2019s third-largest economy) and India (about to surpass China in population) have no desire to be dominated by it.Succumbing to the fear that Thucydides described would be an unnecessary self-fulfilling prophecy for the US.\u00a0Fortunately, polls show that the American public has not yet succumbed to a hysterical portrayal of China as an enemy as strong as the Soviet Union was during the Cold War.Neither China nor the US poses an existential threat to the other the way that Hitler\u2019s Germany or Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union did.\u00a0China is not about to invade the US, and it is unable to expel America from the Western Pacific, where most countries welcome its presence.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nF/A-18 Hornet fighter jets and E-2D Hawkeye plane seen on the US\u00a0aircraft carrier John C.

America has a long history of working with others to create sizeable multilateral institutions that give smaller states both a say and a stake in an extensive rules-based international order.The Trump Administration, though, is disrupting this. It is dismissive of its alliance network, wilfully interferes in allies\u2019 domestic politics, dismantling global multilateral institutions, picks arguments with democratic states, praises authoritarian leaders, and is purposefully degrading America\u2019s soft power.\u00a0A PROBLEMATIC COMPETITIONThe Trump administration\u2019s simultaneous embrace of disruption and competition is problematic for several interlocking reasons.First, the Administration is focusing on winning at geo-economics, perceiving economic relationships in zero-sum terms: An American win means China loses and vice versa. China, however, is on track to becoming the world\u2019s largest economy.\u00a0The US is thus playing to China\u2019s strengths and simply can\u2019t win such a game by itself.\u00a0To succeed it needs economic support from as many as possible, including the other large G7 economies.\u00a0Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach is making such help not just less likely but instead encouraging pushback.\u00a0READ: A Trump doctrine emerges - it is coherent but radical and wrong, a commentaryRecently the EU, Mexico, Canada, and Norway joined China in a unique multiparty case against Washington's imposition of steel and aluminium tariffs.\u00a0The US, to compete, needs to shift from its current embrace of unilateralism and return to leveraging off multilateralism, as it has done successfully in the past.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nDonald Trump has embarked on a protectionist America First agenda since coming to power (Photo: AFP/Brendan Smialowski)\n                            \n\n                    \n                ALL OF US WILL\u00a0LOSE OUTSecond: The Trump Administration is suggesting decoupling from China. Working in combination with the Administration\u2019s other efforts to dismantle the global trading system, decoupling will disrupt the global economic and financial system.Such actions won\u2019t make us richer, instead, all will be poorer, including the US and China.The Trump Administration apparently believes this is an acceptable price for retaining America\u2019s leadership role, albeit the rest of us haven\u2019t been asked.\u00a0Effectively, we will all have to pay a \u201clevy\u201d in lost income and reduced prosperity to keep America on board.\u00a0There are echoes here of America\u2019s revolutionary past: The colonists rejected an empire that provided for the common defence with the battle cry of \u201cno taxation without representation\", which suggests that if the Trump Administration wants to levy an implicit tax on its allies, partners, and friends, it will need their agreement.\u00a0COOPERATION NEEDED\u00a0Lastly and paradoxically, China and the US will need to cooperate to sustain their competition. They will need to maintain the international system in order to compete within it.\u00a0China and the US both regard international trade as critical to their prosperity, but increasingly they want it on their own terms.\u00a0There is a danger that other states embrace autarkic policies as in the protectionist 1930s, sharply constraining international trade. The interwar period\u2019s beggar-my-neighbour economic policies helped no one; instead strengthening the shift to conflict and ultimately global war.China-US competition will remake the international system. For the two great powers, everybody else will be the objects of their strategies, continually called upon to make choices in favour of one or the other.\u00a0In the end, the China-US competition is all about us.Peter Layton is a Visiting Fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute, Griffith University.\u00a0This commentary first appeared on Lowy Institute's blog The Interpreter.

Reuters was not able to confirm the report.FORMER DIPLOMAT DETAINEDEarlier on Tuesday, the Canadian government said that one of its citizens in China had been detained.The International Crisis Group think-tank said on Wednesday it had received no information from Chinese officials about the detention of its employee, former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig, and that it was seeking consular access to him.The Chinese ministry spokesman, Lu, said he had nothing he could say on the details of the case, but said the ICG was not registered in China as a non-governmental organization and Kovrig could have broken Chinese law.About 20 Chinese police officers patrolled outside Canada's embassy on Wednesday but they refused to explain their presence.The Canadian government said it saw no explicit link to the Huawei case.However, Guy Saint-Jacques, Canada's former ambassador to China, asked by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp whether the Kovrig detention was a coincidence, said: \"In China there are no coincidences ... If they want to send you a message they will send you a message.\"Kovrig, a Mandarin speaker, was a political officer at the embassy from 2014-2016 who met with dissidents and travelled to China's restive far west Xinjiang region, Saint-Jacques said.He took an unpaid leave from the embassy because he \"loves China\" and wanted to continue to work in the country, the former ambassador said.\"It's easy to concoct espionage accusations against someone in China,\" he said. \"When I learned the news this morning it deeply saddened me because Michael was a good political officer, but he is not a spy at all.\"The US State Department called on China to \"end all forms of arbitrary detentions.\"Brussels-based ICG said in a statement that it has received no information about Kovrig since his detention and is concerned about his health and safety.\"Michael did not engage in illegal activities nor did he do anything that endangered Chinese national security,\" ICG president Robert Malley told AFP.\"He was doing what all Crisis Group analysts do: undertaking objective and impartial research.\"ELECTRONIC MONITORINGMeng, who was arrested as she was changing planes in Vancouver, has said she is innocent and will contest the allegations in the US if she is extradited.The extradition process, scheduled to start on Feb 6, could take months, even years, if appeals are made in the case.Tuesday was the third day of bail hearings. Meng's defense had argued that she was not a flight risk, citing her longstanding ties to Canada, properties she owns in Vancouver and fears for her health while incarcerated.Her family assured the court she would remain in Vancouver at one of her family houses in an affluent neighborhood. Her husband said he plans to bring the couple's daughter to Vancouver to attend school, and Meng had said she would be grateful for the chance to read a novel after years of working hard.\"I am satisfied that on the particular facts of this case ... the risk of her non-attendance in court can be reduced to an acceptable level by imposing bail conditions,\" said the judge, adding that he was also persuaded by the fact that Meng was a well-educated businesswoman with no criminal record.She must remain in Canada and be accompanied by security guards when she leaves her residence. Meng will pay a cash deposit of C$7 million, with five guarantors liable for a remaining C$3 million if she absconds.Meng was ordered to reappear in court on Feb 6 to make plans for further appearances.pic.twitter.com/ejz2kbgdZD\u2014 Huawei (@Huawei) December 12, 2018In an update on her social media account Wednesday, Meng said that she was in Vancouver and back with her family.\u00a0\"I'm proud of Huawei, and I'm proud of my motherland!

Yet, just when the world needs cooperation the most, the US has largely withdrawn from the international stage.To be sure, even if the US were exercising more global leadership, the ongoing shift from a unipolar to a multipolar world order would still proceed.READ: The exorbitant cost of America going it alone, a commentaryThis trend is being driven partly by demographics. Developed countries are ageing fast, while Asia, Africa, and Latin America have burgeoning populations that are both young and increasingly wealthy, implying both substantial dynamism and greater competition for resources.THE SHADOW PRICE OF NATIONAL SECURITYBut the Trump administration\u2019s penchant for antagonism, protectionism, and short-termism makes matters much worse.For example, tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy not only exacerbate inequality at home, but also fuel a global race to the bottom that undermines fiscal sustainability and increases inequality worldwide.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nTrade disputes sparked by President Trump that have led to tit-for-tat exchanges of tariffs among major trading partners are affecting China, other Asian economies and more vulnerable countries (Photo: AFP/Brendan SMIALOWSKI)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Similarly, while it is understandable that the US does not want to foot the bill for its allies\u2019 security, Trump\u2019s ham-fisted approach to pushing America\u2019s allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) to increase their defence spending is not helping.On the contrary, beyond weakening relations with America\u2019s closest allies, Trump\u2019s tactics have increased tensions with Russia, thereby increasing what economists call the \u201cshadow price\u201d of national security.BLOCKING TRADE INCREASES COSTSThen, of course, there are the Trump administration\u2019s trade policies, which will do much more than \u201cpunish\u201d China.The case for liberalisation has always focused on reducing the transaction costs of global trade, investment, and information flows. By blocking Chinese access to technology, under the guise of national security, the Trump administration increases these costs, not just for China, but also for other countries trying to use trade and technology to advance their growth and development.The Trump administration\u2019s erratic use of sanctions compounds the problem by making it difficult to price transactions with countries that could be friends one day but deemed enemies the next.When the US unilaterally decided to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and re-impose sanctions, the European Union suddenly faced new barriers to trade with Iran. The EU must now attempt to circumvent US sanctions by establishing a \u201cspecial payments system\u201d with China and Russia.READ: Trump says 'I think we'll make a deal with China' on tradeFRAGMENTATIONSo, after decades of increasing openness and globalisation, the world is retreating into fragmentation.

They also know that it is in countries\u2019 best interest not to try.Instead, they hope to continue to deepen their linkages with the international community, acting not as a disruptor, but as a responsible stakeholder committed to upholding global stability.The US should do the same.Andrew Sheng is distinguished fellow of the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong and a member of the UNEP Advisory Council on Sustainable Finance.\u00a0Xiao Geng, president of the Hong Kong Institution for International Finance, is a professor at Peking University HSBC Business School and at the University of Hong Kong\u2019s Faculty of Business and Economics."},

The number of undocumented workers has been declining in recent years; most narcotics are brought into the United States either at existing checkpoints or through other ports of entry; very few terrorists have come across the border illegally since the September 11 attacks, and, contrary to Trump\u2019s assertions, people making illegal crossings are not disproportionally criminal elements.\u00a0Building a wall that would in large part span a hot and inhospitable desert would address none of the problems that anti-immigration activists would like to see solved.READ: When doors to migration slam shut, a commentaryVERY EXPENSIVE, WILL NEVER GET DONESecond, the wall will be extremely expensive. Trump is currently asking for about US$5 billion to begin construction on the wall, but if the wall were ever to be completed the final price would likely be much higher.\u00a0US$5 billion, US$10 billion or even US$20 billion for a government expenditure that helped address a real problem, like climate change, the opioid crisis or healthcare would be, even from a political perspective, a much wiser use of resources for the administration than a wall that eventually will likely be a symbol of Trump\u2019s petulance.READ:\u00a0What is the fight over Trump's border wall about?A third point is that the wall will probably never be completed. If Trump is not re-elected, stopping construction on the wall will be one of the very first actions taken by any Democratic president.\u00a0Even if Trump wins a second term, something that looks less likely with each passing month, Democrats will have future opportunities to cut the funding because public support for the wall has never been strong. This leads to the real possibility that a few miles of uncompleted, rusting half-built wall somewhere on the US-Mexico border in Arizona or Texas will be the lasting physical monument to the Trump presidency.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nAn aerial view of US President Donald Trump's border wall prototypes as seen from Tijuana, Mexico on January 7, 2019 (Photo: AFP/Guillermo Arias)\n                            \n\n                    \n                WHO WILL BUILD?The fourth problem is the question of who will build the wall. Various defence contractors will bid for it. The firms that will be interested in this unusual, but extremely lucrative project will have to do whatever they can to keep bidding costs low.\u00a0Whoever gets the project will then be faced with the challenge of hiring not only skilled and well-compensated workers for much of it, but finding lower-paid and less-skilled workers for other parts of the construction.\u00a0Anybody who has studied the data or spent time on building sites in the United States over the last few decades knows that the construction industry relies heavily on undocumented immigrant workers \u2013 many from Mexico. The temptation to rely on that labour pool will be very strong in the borderlands where the wall is being constructed.\u00a0If that does occur, the political fallout is not likely to drive up the president\u2019s poll numbers.SHOULD DEMOCRATS GIVE IN TO THE PRESIDENT?The Democrats have provided little indication that they will give Trump his wall, but they could score a valuable strategic win if they wrestle generous policy concessions from him in exchange for a compromise.\u00a0After Trump\u2019s recent proposal, Democrats insisted that they would only negotiate on border security once he reopens the government.\u00a0Getting, for example, a real path to citizenship for Dreamers \u2013 not the temporary protections he offered \u2013 in exchange for a wall that seems impossible to build and will ultimately be an embarrassment for Trump, would not be a bad outcome for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\u00a0Ironically, congressional Democrats\u2019 unwillingness to give in to the president may be what spares him this humiliation.Lincoln Mitchell is a writer and scholar based in New York and San Francisco.

With US GDP around US$20 trillion the likely loss is vanishingly small.On the export side, China\u2019s retaliation just means that American soybeans go elsewhere in global markets.\n    Advertisement\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nWorkers transport imported soybean products at a port in Nantong, Jiangsu province, China April 9, 2018.

The IMF describes these effects as \u201csmall but perceptible\u201d. Perhaps they should have said \u201cbarely perceptible\u201d.To get any significant impact, the IMF explores more dramatic scenarios. Even its worst case takes less than 1 per cent\u00a0off US GDP, 0.6 per cent\u00a0off Chinese GDP, and 0.1 per cent\u00a0off the world.Indeed, these worst-case outcomes are not trivial and a full-scale global-wide trade war \u2013 as occurred in the 1930s \u2013 would matter. But these scenarios assume that NAFTA collapses (which now seems unlikely, renamed as USMCA), with most of the predicted disruption coming from new restrictions on automobile trade.\u00a0The scenarios also assume a quite limited capacity on the part of countries to undertake policies to offset the shocks.READ:\u00a0From Xi to Trump, solving the US-China trade war with a phonecall, a commentaryMORE HARM FROM TAX CUTS\u00a0Far more damage was done in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and by the misguided budget austerity during the recovery.

Whether it will improve the human condition will depend on whether corporate, local, national, and international governance can adapt in time.Meanwhile, a new framework for global public-private cooperation has been taking shape. Public-private cooperation is about harnessing the private sector and open markets to drive economic growth for the public good, with environmental sustainability and social inclusiveness always in mind.IDENTIFY INEQUALTY\u2019S CAUSESBut to determine the public good, we first must identify the root causes of inequality.For example, while open markets and increased competition certainly produce winners and losers in the international arena, they may be having an even more pronounced effect on inequality at the national level.Moreover, the growing divide between the precariat and the privileged is being reinforced by Fourth Industrial Revolution business models, which often derive rents from owning capital or intellectual property.READ:\u00a0Explaining the rise of the top 1% super rich, a commentary\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nIn Brazil, despite some success in reducing poverty, wealth inequality remains high and the country has several thousand impoverished \"favela\" areas (Photo: AFP/YASUYOSHI CHIBA)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Closing that divide requires us to recognise that we are living in a new type of innovation-driven economy, and that new global norms, standards, policies, and conventions are needed to safeguard the public trust.A NEW ECONOMY, DISRUPTEDThe new economy has already disrupted and recombined countless industries, and dislocated millions of workers.It is dematerialising production, by increasing the knowledge intensity of value creation.

They are universal, and thus require a global response. Failing to adopt a new cooperative approach would be a tragedy for humankind.To draft a blueprint for a shared global-governance architecture, we must avoid becoming mired in the current moment of crisis management.Specifically, this task will require two things of the international community: Wider engagement and heightened imagination.The engagement of all stakeholders in sustained dialogue will be crucial, as will the imagination to think systemically, and beyond one\u2019s own short-term institutional and national considerations.These will be the two organising principles of the World Economic Forum\u2019s upcoming annual meeting in Davos-Klosters, which will convene under the theme ofGlobalisation 4.0: Shaping a New Architecture in the Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.Ready or not, a new world is upon us.Klaus Schwab is Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum."},

And if governments ever make it illegal to use coins in retail stores and banks, their value must ultimately collapse.Many crypto-evangelists insist that Bitcoin is \u201cdigital gold,\u201d in part because the long-term supply is algorithmically capped at 21 million.\u00a0But this is nutty. For one thing, unlike gold \u2013 which has always had other purposes and today is employed widely in new technologies from iPhones to spacecraft \u2013 Bitcoin has no alternative use. And even if Bitcoiners manage to find a way to lower the phenomenal energy cost of verifying transactions, the very nature of decentralised ledger systems makes them vastly less efficient than systems with a trusted central party like a central bank.\u00a0READ: The beginning of the end of cryptocurrencies and the rise of one alternative, a commentaryTake away near-anonymity and no one will want to use it; keep it and advanced-economy governments will not tolerate it.The evangelists dismiss such concerns: Bitcoin can still be incredibly valuable as long as enough people perceive it as digital gold.\u00a0After all, they argue, money is a social convention. But economists (including me) who have worked on this kind of problem for five decades have found that price bubbles surrounding intrinsically worthless assets must eventually burst.\u00a0The prices of assets that do have real underlying value cannot deviate arbitrarily far from historical benchmarks. And government-issued money is hardly a pure social convention; governments pay employees and suppliers, and demand tax payments in fiat currency.But it is too soon to say how the new world of digital currencies will play out. Central banks will get into the game (their reserves are already a form of wholesale digital currency), but that is not the end of the story.\u00a0US Treasury Direct, for example, already offers retail customers an extremely low-cost way to hold very short-term Treasury debt for amounts as little as US$100, tradable to others in the system.\u00a0Still, heavy security makes the system relatively cumbersome to use, and just maybe governments might adopt one of today\u2019s private digital technologies.READ:\u00a0Even with blockchain and cryptocurrency, trust still needed, a commentary\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nSemiconductor giant TSMC says cryptocurrency mining, which requires a lot of computing power, will be key driver for growth (Photo: AFP/JACK GUEZ)\n                            \n\n                    \n                THEY COULD STILL BE WORTH A LOTFor the moment, the real question is if and when global regulation will stamp out privately constructed systems that are expensive for governments to trace and monitor.\u00a0Any single large advanced economy foolish enough to try to embrace cryptocurrencies, as Japan did last year, risks becoming a global destination for money-laundering. (Japan\u2019s subsequent moves to distance itself from cryptocurrencies were perhaps one cause of this year\u2019s gyrations.)\u00a0In the end, advanced economies will surely coordinate on cryptocurrency regulation, as they have on other measures to prevent money laundering and tax evasion.But that leaves out a lot of disgruntled players. After all, many today \u2013 including Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Russia \u2013 are labouring under United States financial sanctions.\u00a0Their governments will not necessarily care about global externalities if they encourage cryptocurrencies that might have value as long as they are used somewhere.So, while we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by this year\u2019s cryptocurrency price bust, the price of these coins is not necessarily zero.\u00a0Like lottery tickets, there is a high probability that they are worthless. There is also an extremely small outside chance that they will be worth a great deal someday, for reasons that currently are difficult to anticipate.Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist of the IMF, is Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University."},

I also asked about the pervasiveness and impact of unwelcome partisan exchanges.Participants were asked to indicate how much they agreed with each statement, from strongly disagree to strongly agree.Most of the workers were based in the eastern or southeastern United States, but some were scattered throughout the country. Key characteristics of the data such as age, gender and ethnicities are broadly in line with national statistics.27 per cent of participants agreed or strongly agreed that work had become more tense as a result of political discussions, while about a third said such talk about the \u201cups and downs\u201d of politicians is a \u201ccommon distraction\u201d.One in four indicated they actively avoid certain people at work who try to convince them that their views are right, while one in five said they had actually lost friendships as a result.And all this has serious consequences for worker health and productivity.Over a quarter said political divisions have increased their stress levels, making it harder to get things done. Almost a third of this group said they called in sick on days when they didn\u2019t feel like working, compared with 17 per cent among those who didn\u2019t report feeling stressed about politics.A quarter also reported putting in less effort than expected, versus 12 per cent.

For example, back in September 2016, 17 per cent of those surveyed by the American Psychological Association said they felt tense or stressed out as a result of political discussions at work.The association did a follow-up survey in May 2017 already revealing increased stress levels, a drop in worker productivity and other consequences following the election of Donald Trump.My findings, however, suggest things have gotten even worse. That 2017 survey, for example, reported 15 per cent of respondents saying they had difficulty getting work done. My data puts it at 26 per cent.WHAT MANAGERS CAN DOI also reached out to 20 business leaders from a variety of industries whom I have become acquainted with over the years in my role as a professor \u2013 to find out what company managers are doing about politics-related stress.I discovered a few common themes.One was that the problem often began with a higher-level employee sharing his or her political views with others, whether welcome or not, making underlings feel they could engage in similar behavior in the office.A manager of a publishing company, for example, noted that he had to fire one of his unit leaders because he could not put his political beliefs away during his shift despite a series of reprimands.Another was that banning all political discussions was also bad policy, since it opened the door to lawsuits over free speech issues.What the \u201cright\u201d policy about what boundaries to set for political chatter at work remains an open question.The key point is that the business leaders I spoke with tended to agree that managers need to get their heads out of the sand and address the problem head on. They seemed to think a lot of managers appeared to be ignoring the problem and hoping it would go away.A number of them added that they are now investing in programmes that help manage conflicts and disagreements at work \u2013 among employees and with customers.At the end of the day, to be fair, there\u2019s little companies can do about how politically divided the nation becomes.But keeping it from stressing out employees at work and causing productivity and other problems is primarily about effective leadership and being proactive, and showing employees a level of civility that is often absent outside of the workplace.Wayne Hochwarter is professor of organizational behaviour at Florida State University.

Yet, apart from a relatively recent acceleration, real wages have barely budged since the Great Recession and in fact are little changed from the 1980s.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementThis puzzle can be even more confounding when you consider some of the biggest American companies have been boosting the minimum wages they pay their employees to levels way above the federal minimum of US$7.25 an hour.\u00a0Amazon became the latest this month, promising to pay all workers no less than US$15 an hour, following similar raises for employees of Costco, Walmart, Target and others.I believe there\u2019s good reason to be skeptical that these sporadic pay hikes will solve the problem of stagnant wages.In fact, it is the rise of such superstar companies as Amazon that has contributed to the problem in the first place.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementSTAGNANT WAGESWages typically need to rise 3.5 to 4 per cent a year following an economic recession in order to help workers recoup their losses from the downturn.But average hourly earnings growth for private sector non-farm workers has been significantly below that, and most of the gains have been wiped out by inflation.As a result, workers are getting an ever-shrinking share of US\u00a0national income, which declined from about 65 per cent in the 1960s to as low as 56 per cent in 2014.\n    Advertisement\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nJob seekers line up to apply during Amazon Jobs Day,\u00a0a job fair at the Amazon.com Fulfillment Center in Fall River, Aug\u00a02, 2017.

While there\u2019s certainly truth to each explanation, a new one has been gaining traction: Superstar companies.RISE OF SUPERSTAR\u00a0COMPANIESAmazon, Google, Uber, Federal Express and a few other exceptional companies have gobbled up an increasing share of their industry\u2019s markets to a point where small companies just can\u2019t compete.In retail, for example, the top four companies controlled 30 per cent of sales in 2012, up from 15 per cent in 1982. In finance, the share rose to 35 per cent from 24 per cent. And in the service sector, it climbed to 15 per cent from about 10 per cent.The industry concentration, along with inexpensive loans engineered by the Federal Reserve\u2019s ultra-low interest rate policy, has allowed a select few companies to make significant investments in productive technologies, such as in artificial intelligence and automation.\u00a0This has helped them increase their market shares even further. And in turn, this is what is making it easier for these companies to lift wages, whether by setting higher minimum wage floors for their workers or simply paying more across the board.While that\u2019s all fine and good, the problem is that more than half of American workers in the private sector are employed by companies with fewer than 500 employees.\u00a0These small businesses have suffered as a result of the superstars\u2019 growing dominance and also can\u2019t take advantage of the record-low borrowing costs because they do not have access to the stock and bond markets.Because small- and mid-size employers do most of the hiring in the US, it is their wages that dominate the industry standards. And they are having a hard time increasing pay for their workers.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nSmall startup firms, which are key to US job growth, are struggling to find sufficient financing to expand, according to a new survey AFP/SPENCER PLATT\n                            \n\n                    \n                The rise of superstar companies is also what is driving widening income inequality today. While we usually think about inequality in terms of the gap between higher and low earners, researchers have found that the bigger issue is the gap between rich and poor companies, which in turn reinforces the gap in pay between individuals.It is a good thing that the likes of Amazon are setting a much higher floor under their workers\u2019 wages, but the slimmer profit margins at their smaller rivals make it virtually impossible for them to do the same. This will cement the superstars\u2019 market power even further.READ:\u00a0Helping Grab drivers find jobs and have enough money an uphill battle, a commentaryAN INCENTIVE TO ACTFortunately, superstar companies have an incentive to do something about this because a situation in which wage growth is below par is bad for business as well as for the workers.That\u2019s because low wages threaten the physical and mental health of a large swath of the workforce as increasing numbers of workers can\u2019t afford to invest in good food, preventative health care, continuing education and skills training.\u00a0And in a vibrant economy, workers must stay healthy and educated to remain productive. Besides, low wages also reduce consumption and economic growth.As such, stagnant wages are one of the main reasons overall US\u00a0productivity growth has also been sluggish in recent years and declining toward zero. This is very bad for the US\u00a0economy and companies, both large and small, since high rates of productivity are vital to a country\u2019s long-term growth rates \u2013 and to higher wages as well.The solution is in thinking about worker productivity as a collective resource. Companies certainly have an incentive to keep labour costs low, but they also have a strong incentive to ensure, collectively, that worker productivity grows over time.READ: Workers everywhere face the same challenge - rapidly depreciating skills, a commentary\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n\n\nAn employee collects items ordered by Amazon.com customers through the company's two-hour delivery service Prime Now in a warehouse in San Francisco, California, US, Dec\u00a020, 2017.

Another upturn in the US inflation cycle is at hand.Since the Great Disinflation of the early 1980s, when the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) plunged from 14.7 per cent in March 1980 to 2.4 per cent in July 1983, inflation has generally remained in a relatively narrow 1 to 5 per cent range for a quarter-century.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisementWhen the economy softened, inflation slid to the lower end of that range, and when it strengthened in the late 1980s, late 1990s, and in the pre-crisis 2000s, it moved to the upper end.Such is the case today.RISING INFLATIONNot surprisingly, this pattern has been slow to emerge in the current cycle, largely owing to an unusually weak post-crisis economic recovery.\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisementBut now a confluence of global and domestic forces is starting to push inflation higher and should continue to do so for some time.That will pose a challenge to the Federal Reserve, which operates under a price-stability mandate. Recent volatility in stocks and bonds suggests that these risks could prove vexing to financial markets as well.The global risk to US inflation reflects not only a cyclical upturn in the world economy, but also mounting trade frictions that pose serious threats to the stability of global value, or supply, chains (GVCs).As GVCs have grown in importance over time, so has the internationalisation of inflation.\n    Advertisement\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS inflation is something that has baffled and worried economists given the very low unemployment rate which would normally drive prices higher (Photo:\u00a0AFP/Robyn Beck)\n                            \n\n                    \n                In economic terms, that means broadening the assessment of inflation risks from a focus on domestic \u201coutput gaps\u201d \u2013 the difference between actual and potential (or full employment) GDP \u2013 to the global output gap.Significantly, recent research by the Bank for International Settlements has found that a global output gap of about 1 per cent \u2013 precisely the outcome for all advanced economies over the past five years \u2013 reduces inflation by 0.9 per cent.SPILLING OVER TO THE REST OF THE WORLDTwo major disruptions currently occurring in GVCs are likely to have a meaningful impact on the internationalisation of US inflation.First and foremost is the Trump administration\u2019s trade war with China. The initial waves of US tariffs on Chinese imports are aimed mainly at intermediate goods that are processed by low-cost China-centric GVCs.READ:\u00a0As trade war looms, China\u2019s growth strategy in great peril, a commentaryThese tariffs will raise the prices of about half of Chinese goods imports, which totalled US$506 billion in 2017, by 10 per cent today and 25 per cent in 2019.The recent reworking of the North American Free Trade Agreement should also have an impact on GVC-induced disinflation.With its more stringent local-content and minimum-wage requirements, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) injects new cost pressures into the GVC that has played an important role in the establishment of a fully-integrated North American auto production platform over the past quarter-century.NAFTA may not have been perfect, but under USMCA there is a different cost calculus for vehicles, which account for fully 3.7 per cent of the items included in the US CPI.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nAn aerial view of cars at the Volkswagen plant in Puebla, Mexico, part of an auto industry revolutionized under the old NAFTA trade agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico (Photo: AFP/Jose Castanares)\n                            \n\n                    \n                RISING WAGES AND A TIGHT LABOUR MARKET PUTS PRESSUREWhile this new strain of global pressures on US inflation reflects the impact of aggressive trade policies on GVCs, the domestic pressures stem from a more familiar source: An extremely tight labour market.The unemployment rate fell to 3.7 per cent in September, its lowest level since December 1969.Below 4 per cent unemployment rates have become extremely rare in the US. There was a brief episode in 2000, when inflation generally remained under control, and a more protracted one in the late 1960s, setting the stage for the Great Inflation of the 1970s.READ:\u00a0A trade war is bad news for working-class Americans, a commentaryThe current tightness of the US labour market is problematic for two reasons. The first is a nascent increase in long-dormant wage pressures.Average hourly earnings are now running 2.8 per cent above the year-earlier level, reinforcing an acceleration that began in 2015, and well above the subdued 2 per cent post-crisis average from 2010 through 2014.Moreover, there are signs that wage gains are now broadening out, with the balance tilting away from low wage-inflation industries such as manufacturing, health care, and education into higher wage-inflation industries such as finance, the information sector, and professional and business services.At the current below 4 per cent unemployment rate, overall wage inflation could easily move into the 3.5 per cent zone by mid-2019.TROUBLE ON THE HORIZONThe second conclusion to draw from an extremely tight US labour market is that, unlike earlier periods of low unemployment when domestic wage pressures were constrained by GVCs, today\u2019s mounting wage inflation will be tempered by a smaller GVC offset.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\n(Photo: AFP/Karen Bleier)\n\n\n                            \n\n                    \n                READ: Beneath the rose-tinted surface of a glowing US economy, a looming recession, a commentaryAbsent an unlikely acceleration in productivity, it is the confluence of these two forces \u2013 a tight domestic labour market and new global pressures \u2013 that spells trouble on the US inflation front.Such an outcome has important and actionable consequences for the Fed. The federal funds rate is currently at only 2.25 per cent. That is little different from the underlying rate of so-called core inflation (which excludes the Consumer Price Index\u2019s volatile food and energy components), currently running at 2 to 2.2 per cent, depending on which measure one chooses.\u00a0Therein lies the Fed\u2019s dilemma. Knowing full well that monetary policy works with lags of 12 to 18 months, the central bank has to be forward-looking, setting its policy rate on the basis of where it thinks inflation is headed, not on the basis of a backward-looking assessment of where inflation has been.And that\u2019s precisely the problem: Based on the confluence of global and domestic pressures outlined above, 3 to 3.5 per cent inflation is well in sight over the next year.MORE TIGHTENING TO COMETo counter such a likely upturn in US inflation, the Fed is entirely correct to send the message that there is considerably more to come in its current tightening cycle.In fact, there is an increasingly compelling argument that a forward-looking Fed is actually \u201cbehind the curve,\u201d because its policy rate currently is only just equal to the backward-looking core inflation rate.That could mean that the Fed must contemplate monetary tightening that significantly exceeds the so-called comfort zone of normalisation that financial markets are currently discounting.Unlike a certain Fed-bashing president, I would hardly call that a crazy conclusion.Stephen S Roach, a faculty member at Yale University and former Chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, is the author of Unbalanced: The Codependency of America and China."},

Xi must hold out,\u00a0waiting for better terms from Washington, even at the risk of higher tariffs and stiffer trade protectionist measures.TRADE IS NOW POLITICISEDThe challenge Beijing and its trade officials struggle with is that the White House has politicised bilateral trade negotiations, while granting greater prominence to John Bolton, White House national security advisor, a self-proclaimed China and Russia basher, who is also cheerleader of the neo-conservative movement.To make matters worse, Vice-President Mike Pence had delivered a scathing speech against China when he appeared at the Hudson Institute earlier this month. According to White House transcripts, Pence is quoted as saying that:\n    AdvertisementBeijing is also using its power like never before. Chinese ships routinely patrol around the Senkaku Islands, which are administered by Japan. And while China\u2019s leader stood in the Rose Garden at the White House in 2015 and said that his country had, and I quote, \u201cno intention to militarise\u201d the South China Sea, today, Beijing has deployed advanced anti-ship and anti-air missiles atop an archipelago of military bases constructed on artificial islands.Do these remarks sound like a strategy to peacefully engage Beijing in trade talks?Instead, Pence raised the stakes, blasting the Chinese government and hinting at the potential of war if Democrats retake control of\u00a0Congress and Trump gets impeached, an outcome that would see Pence in the White House.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS Vice President Mike Pence lashes out at China in a speech accusing it of seeking to turn US President Donald Trump out of office. (Photo: AFP/Jim WATSON)\n                            \n\n                    \n                Surely, Beijing does not wish for Pence to become the US President in the near future, and therefore would not meddle in the US\u2019s mid-term elections to help the Democrats, contrary to Pence's claims.GETTING A HANDLE ON THE USAdditionally, White House\u00a0Director of Trade and Policy Peter Navarro has refused to hold talks with Chinese trade officials in a polite manner. A hawk and author of the book Death by China, accounts suggest he has little experience of the country and cannot be said to have visited it frequently or have a deep, first-hand appreciation of China.He has no real experience in the business world, with\u00a0regard\u00a0to the negotiations process. He has never been involved in the give-and-take of deal-making, unlike his top boss, President Trump. He had spent much of his professional career in academia as a professor emeritus at the University of California, Irvine.And yet, President Xi and his aides are at the mercy of Bolton and Navarro in trying to reach an agreement with President Trump on a trade agreement.Such circumstances do not bode well for Beijing and hence they hold no real incentive for seeking compromise and hammering out a deal, since both Bolton and Navarro remain stubborn and unfriendly in their dealings with China.\u00a0Indeed, even high-ranking Chinese official struggle to get a handle on their American counterparts.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nChina is currently in an escalating trade war with the Trump administration (Photo: AFP/STR)\n                            \n\n                    \n                In Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai\u2019s recent interview with\u00a0the National Public Radio\u00a0in Washington, he said he was \u201cconfused\u201d about US policy statements\u00a0and does not know how to improve dialogue between Beijing and Washington.His admission is shocking considering that he had been appointed to understand and work with the White House and America in a more insightful and informed manner.Yet, it should come as no surprise since Trump has pledged to endorse an \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy, but flashpoints between the two have grown more salient, including issues related to the South China Sea and Taiwan.THE OUTLOOKAccordingly, if President Trump persists in putting forward politics above economics on Sino-US trade talks, President Xi will not likely budge or compromise - even if that means the Chinese economy will face hard times.\u00a0There are some issues that are non-negotiable for Beijing, and the trade war is not one that will see easy compromise.It is true that the Chinese have the upper hand, given its massive trade surpluses with the US and as the US trade deficit with China is on track to increase this year, notwithstanding Trump\u2019s tariffs on a greater number of Chinese imports.READ:\u00a0China could easily win Trump\u2019s trade war, a commentary\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nChina and the US have been embroiled for months in a trade conflict that has threatened to hurt consumers in both countries.

Beijing could demonstrate its willingness for compromise by allowing American farmers to ship soybeans to China, as well as re-opening US LNG (liquefied natural gas) shipments to the country.\u00a0Such gestures of conciliation might persuade President Trump to rein in the trade war hawks, including Navarro and Bolton.But most importantly, Xi should make a phone call to the White House, so the two leaders can become personal friends again and make continued progress on bilateral trade talks.In doing so, both China and the US can move forward with win-win trade agreements.Tom McGregor is a commentator on Asia-Pacific affairs based in Beijing."},

In 2010, China\u2019s GDP surpassed Japan\u2019s as measured in dollars (though it remains far behind Japan in per capita terms).\u00a0It is difficult to remember that a little over two decades ago, many Americans feared being overtaken by Japan, not China. Books predicted a Japanese-led Pacific bloc that would exclude the US, and even an eventual war with Japan.\u00a0Instead, during President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, the US reaffirmed its security alliance with Japan at the same time that it accepted the rise of China and supported its admission to the World Trade Organisation.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to visit China's President Xi Jinping in October (Photo: AFP/Greg BAKER)\n                            \n\n                    \n                \n    AdvertisementREAD: China and Japan, a blossoming thaw after a decade of glum, a commentaryCRACKS IN THE ALLIANCEIn the early 1990s, many observers believed that the US-Japan alliance would be discarded as a Cold War relic. Trade tensions were high.\u00a0Senator Paul Tsongas campaigned for president in 1992 on the slogan, \u201cThe Cold War is over and Japan has won.\u201d\u00a0The Clinton administration began with Japan-bashing, but after a two-year process of negotiation, Clinton and then-Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto issued a declaration in 1996 that proclaimed the alliance to be the bedrock of stability for post-Cold War East Asia.There was a deeper level of malaise, however, and although it was rarely expressed openly, it related to the Japanese concern that it would be marginalised as the US turned toward China.\u00a0When I was involved in negotiating the reaffirmation of the alliance in the mid-1990s, my Japanese counterparts, seated across a table festooned with national flags rarely discussed China formally. But later, over drinks, they would ask whether America would shift its focus from Japan to China as the latter grew in strength.Such anxieties are not surprising: When two allies\u2019 defence capacities are not symmetrical, the more dependent party is bound to worry more about the partnership. Over the years, some Japanese have argued that Japan should become a \u201cnormal\u201d country with a fuller panoply of military capabilities.\u00a0Some experts have even suggested that Japan drop some of its anti-nuclear principles and develop nuclear weapons. But such measures would raise more problems than they would solve. Even if Japan took steps to become a \u201cnormal\u201d country (whatever that term may imply), it would still not equal the power of the US or China.NEW CONCERNSToday, Japan has a new set of concerns about American abandonment. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d orientation and protectionist policies pose a new risk to the alliance. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a blow to Japan.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nTrump's brashness and 'America First' policies have caused consternation in Britain across the political spectrum and society as a whole (Photo: AFP/JIM WATSON)\n                            \n\n                    \n                While Abe has skilfully played to Trump\u2019s ego to deflect conflict, acute differences remain. The Trump administration\u2019s imposition of steel and aluminium tariffs on national security grounds surprised Abe and has fuelled disquiet in Japan.The Trump administration has also suggested that US allies in Asia should do more to defend themselves and openly questioned the value of forward deployed US forces. Some analysts wonder whether Trump\u2019s actions will force Japan to hedge its bets and edge toward China.\u00a0But that is unlikely at this stage. While such options may be explored, they will remain limited, given Japanese concerns about Chinese domination. The US alliance remains the best option \u2013 unless Trump goes much further.STILL GOING STRONGThus far, the alliance remains remarkably strong. Abe reached out early to President-elect Trump, meeting him first at Trump Tower in New York and then during visits to Washington and Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s Florida residence.\u00a0The Abe-Trump relationship allowed the Pentagon to maintain close cooperation on security matters. North Korea helped focus the alliance\u2019s attention and provided an opportunity for Trump to assure Japan that the US was behind Japan \u201c100 per cent.\u201dAbe and Trump both supported the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy against North Korea, working hard to build international support for United Nations sanctions. Meanwhile, Japan announced a major new investment in ballistic missile defence and cooperated in its joint development.\u00a0\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nLast year, Japan\u00a0approved the installation of two Aegis Ashore missile defence systems to defend the country against North Korea's growing nuclear and missile threats (Photo: AFP/Daniel Mihailescu)\n                            \n\n                    \n                On the other hand, Trump\u2019s surprising reversal in attitude toward North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after their Singapore summit in June raised Japanese concerns about a US deal focusing on intercontinental missiles and ignoring the medium-range missiles that could reach Japan.READ:\u00a0Here are the real reasons why Kim Jong Un wants an end to the Korean War, a commentaryBURDEN SHARINGTrump\u2019s rhetoric about burden sharing has also raised concern. While Japan\u2019s defense expenditure is little above 1 per cent of GDP, it contributes significant host-country support.\u00a0The US Department of Defense estimates suggest that the Japanese government pays roughly 75 per cent of the cost of supporting US forces in Japan.

More such deals should follow.\n    AdvertisementEurope, Japan, and China have all criticised the US stance and portray themselves as champions of multilateralism. This is only half true: Europe has built its own web of trade agreements, and China, itself a fairly transactional power, regards global rules as an embodiment of yesterday\u2019s Western dominance.But on this issue (as on climate change), there is currently more commonality among non-US partners than there is between them and the US.READ: China has outgrown the world market, needs to rebalance economy, a commentaryGAME #2: DISCIPLINE CHINAOn the second board is the discipline China game. For a decade or so, many in the US have claimed that China\u2019s categorisation as a developing country, and the resulting favourable treatment it enjoys at the WTO, do not reflect the true strength of an economy whose goods exports amount to US$2 trillion, or 11 per cent of world trade.As Susan Schwab, President George W Bush\u2019s Trade Representative, put it\u00a0back in 2011, in trade discussions elephants were hiding behind mice. The Trump administration now wants to trap the Chinese elephant.The internal heterogeneity of China\u2019s economy is indeed exceptionally high for a developing country. Parts of China are poor, and parts wealthy. Some industries are unsophisticated, while others are at the cutting edge of innovation. The latter shouldn\u2019t hide behind the former.America\u2019s grievances regarding China\u2019s behaviour, from its treatment of intellectual property to its implicit and explicit subsidies and policy-motivated takeovers of foreign industrial jewels, are essentially shared by its G7 partners.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nThe trade war between the US and China deepened when President Donald Trump announced he would push ahead with tariffs on US$200 billion in Chinese goods.

This claim is more contentious, because leaders in Beijing regard state ownership of enterprises as a matter of sovereign choice, and do not want to renounce big industrial policy endeavours. But there is room for discussion.READ: From Xi to Trump, solving the US-China trade war with a phonecall, a commentaryGAME #3: ROLL BACK CHINAAll in all, the discipline China game is one in which the US, Europe, Japan, and Canada are largely aligned. All look forward to a robust negotiation with the Chinese.This makes the discipline China game very different from the third contest, the roll back China game. This game is not about the enforcement of trade rules, or their design, but about the sheer geopolitical rivalry between the incumbent superpower and a rising challenger.As Kevin Rudd, the former Australian prime minister, noted in a remarkable speech a few weeks ago, the US security establishment has become convinced that strategic engagement with China has not paid off and should give way to strategic competition \u2013 a stance that would encompass all dimensions of the bilateral relationship.In early October, a particularly harsh speech\u00a0by US Vice-President Mike Pence illustrated Rudd\u2019s point.Europe, Japan, and Canada are not part of this rivalry \u2013 they simply do not matter in the same way that the US and China do. But they are inevitably part of its diplomatic, economic, and, for Japan at least, security components.\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    \n\nUS Vice President Mike Pence lashes out at China in a speech accusing it of seeking to turn US President Donald Trump out of office.

And, for all their reluctance, they may well end up aligned with the US, for two reasons: A hardening of the rivalry with the US would drive the Chinese leadership further from Western values, and they ultimately depend on the US for their own security.READ:\u00a0Can China-US relations step back from the brink? A commentaryThe problem, however, is that it is still not clear in which game President Trump intends to score a victory. Does he intend to play a long game? And, if so, what are his aims? Nobody really knows.A DILEMMAFor the non-US G7 countries, this uncertainty creates a dilemma. Should they engage with China on WTO reform and the strengthening of the associated disciplines? This is a topic on which they could help pave the way for an eventual global compromise.The risk, however, is that if China fears that the US really aims at winning the rollback game, and expects the rest of the West to fall in line eventually, it will refuse to make meaningful concessions.Alternatively, the rest of the G7 could align with the US, at the risk of antagonising China and eventually being strategically demoted if Trump ultimately settles on a bilateral deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping. If that game prevails, the non-US G7 will end up being the losers.Absent a no-risk strategy, Europe, Japan, and Canada might well choose to wait and see. This would be the surest way to be sidelined in all possible circumstances and provide a demonstration that only the US-Chinese \u201cG2\u201d matters.What these countries are facing is a test of leadership, which they may pass or fail.
